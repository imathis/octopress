<div class="entry-content"><p>One of the greatest things about working for yourself is the mobility.</p>

<p>Freedom comes in a lot of forms:  Free time for doing things you really enjoy.  Freedom to make your own decisions without a boss.  And freedom to travel at will.  It&#8217;s great to know that I don&#8217;t have to ask people for time off or count sick days and I need to start taking advantage of this more.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been spending the last year or so transitioning my business and income to <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-i-almost-accomplished-my-passive-income-goal-for-2008/">be more passive</a> and more online because I&#8217;ve had this goal in mind for a long time: I&#8217;d like to travel the world and earning money doing it!</p>

<p>The idea of traveling around the world on a shoe-string budget picking up odd jobs and staying on couches doesn&#8217;t really appeal to me.  What DOES appeal to me is having a business that will continue to grow and thrive as I travel the world.  The internet has made this possible.</p>

<p><strong>What city are you going to?</strong>
I&#8217;m going to Buenos Aires Argentina first just because I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s amazing.  I&#8217;ll probably just drop into a hostel there and figure it out from there.  I eventually hope to see a bunch of places around Argentina, but I&#8217;m deliberately leaving it unplanned.  I don&#8217;t want to have the deadline looming of a pre-purchased flight or anything like that.  I want to just explore as I go.</p>

<p><strong>When are you going?</strong>
Probably around early May after attending a friend&#8217;s wedding in the states.</p>

<p><strong>Why Buenos Aires?</strong>
I first heard about this place from <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferriss</a> (this trip is very Tim Ferriss-esque overall) and have since read a great deal about it.  Here are a few things I like about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#8217;s called the Paris of South America - gorgeous city, cafes, clubs, shops, etc</p></li>
<li><p>Extremely safe and welcoming of foreigners</p></li>
<li><p>Still inexpensive</p></li>
<li><p>Beautiful women</p></li>
<li><p>Fast and widely available internet</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Basically the only bad thing I can find about it is that people are allowed to smoke in bars and clubs there.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pinguinolab/261686053/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/01/ba31.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashobbs/363201423/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/01/ba21.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-silva/2207382770/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/01/ba11.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I plan to go to a bunch of other places after Bueones Aires as well.</p>

<p><strong>How can you afford to travel the world?</strong>
It&#8217;s not that expensive.  Most people think of world travel like a vacation - and that&#8217;s not the right way to think about it.</p>

<p>Vacations are expensive because you still have all your expenses back home (mortgage/rent, car payment, gym, cell phone, etc) to make in ADDITION to the new expenses you just rang up (plane ticket, hotels, etc).  It&#8217;s basically like living in two cities at once.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m not taking a VACATION to South America - I&#8217;m actually MOVING there.  This means I will not be paying any living expenses in the U.S., I will be selling my car, and will be canceling or putting on hold all other expenses (phone, gym, etc).</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t be staying in hotels there or paying tourist prices.  I will be renting an apartment (probably month to month).  The plane ticket to get there isn&#8217;t cheap (about $1,000) but once there most travel around South America can be done on buses or trains (or even short plane trips city to city) very inexpensively.</p>

<p><strong>How (in)expensive is it to live there? </strong>
Well, I&#8217;m told you can rent a fully furnished apartment with AC and internet included for around $400/month US which is just ridiculous.  There is an elaborate subway and bus system in Beunos Aires (which costs I think 25 cents to ride?) so you don&#8217;t need a car.  And the best steak dinner you&#8217;ve ever had in your life is about $5.</p>

<p>And that is living a rather nice lifestyle.  You can also stay in shared Hostels for about $7 per night and eat more modest meals.  This would bring your total living expenses in Buenos Aires down to about $15 per day or $450 per month if you really wanted to.</p>

<p>In short, I actually plan to be spending MUCH LESS than I currently do to live in the U.S.  (Perhaps with the plane ticket the first month might about break even with U.S. expenses.)</p>

<p><strong>What are you going to bring with you?</strong>
As little as possible.  Basically a backpack a few clothes, my laptop, and a camera.  <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/07/11/how-to-travel-the-world-with-10-pounds-or-less-plus-how-to-negotiate-convertibles-and-luxury-treehouses/">This post</a> helped me out a lot and a number of things I&#8217;ve read have convinced of the wisdom of traveling light.  I still need to get a good backpack.</p>

<p><strong>What will you do with all your stuff?</strong>
Sell it or give it away on Craigslist.com most likely, aside from a few boxes my current roommate might let me keep in the closet.  If you live in Houston and want a pet tarantula send me an email.  I have two!</p>

<p><strong>How will you be making money?</strong>
The same way I make money in Houston.  I will have to give my properties to a management company most likely (which will reduce the cash flow).  But otherwise it won&#8217;t change much.</p>

<p><strong>Ever heard of geo-arbitrage?</strong>
Yes.  For those who don&#8217;t know, one awesome thing about making money on the internet is what&#8217;s sometimes referred to as &#8220;geo-arbitrage&#8221;.  For the first time in history, the internet has allowed people to not have to reside in the same city where they earn a living.  That means you can EARN money in dollars or euros and SPEND it in a currency that offers a good exchange rate (like Argentine pesos) - in effect, instantly increasing the value of your money.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you going with?</strong>
No one!  I&#8217;m going by myself.  This will be a good process of self discovery and force me to meet new people I&#8217;m sure.  I&#8217;ve done trips in the past with groups and it&#8217;s hard to really get the feel for a culture since you just stay together all the time (and ultimately end up getting on each others nerves a bit by the end).</p>

<p>If you happen to be in the same city when I am though I&#8217;m always up for meeting.  Drop me a line.</p>

<p>Actually, a big shout out is owed to <a href="http://www.manuelzeh.de/">Manuel Zeh</a> - a friend who is currently traveling the world (and in Honduras?) who has been traveling for years and gave me a ton of tips.  Hopefully our paths will cross somewhere down there!</p>

<p><strong>Won&#8217;t you get bored and lonely?</strong>
Well, honestly I have no idea.  Maybe.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m leaving it unplanned.  I might stay there for a year and come back, or eventually head to another continent, or travel indefinitely, or be back in a month.</p>

<p>But I doubt I&#8217;ll get bored or lonely.  After all, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ll be visiting museums or laying on a beach.  I&#8217;m going to be LIVING there.  So I&#8217;ll still be working a lot on my business, playing sports, joining clubs, meeting other entrepreneurs, partying, etc.  I&#8217;ll be doing many of the things I do in Houston and hopefully lots more.  I plan on taking up a few new hobbies.  Also, I can be <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/how-to-make-a-bunch-of-new-friends-in-any-new-city.html">pretty outgoing</a> when I need to be.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have plans to stay in Houston long term, so I figure world travel will be a good way to try a bunch of new cities and ultimately decide where I might want to live.</p>

<p><strong>How is your Spanish?</strong>
Hablo un poco espanol.  Necesito practicar y creo que Buenos Aires es un lugar perfecto!</p>

<p><strong>Can you send a postcard?</strong>
I&#8217;ll be blogging my way throughout the journey (and the preparation leading up to it - the trip isn&#8217;t until May this year) with lots of photos so stay tuned.  As always, I&#8217;d love to hear your suggestions or tips if you&#8217;ve had a similar adventure or know the area well.</p>

<p>I think this will be an excellent experiment in truly Breaking Free, and I hope to share as much of it as I can with you!</p>
