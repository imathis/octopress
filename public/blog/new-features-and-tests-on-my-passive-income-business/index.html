  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey Folks,</p>

<p>The past week or so I&#8217;ve been working on a cool new feature for my passive income business, <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com">UniversityTutor.com</a>: MAP BASED SEARCHING FOR TUTORS!</p>

<p>This is using some Google Maps technology underneath to integrate with my site and hopefully it will make it much easier for people to find tutors based on their location.</p>

<p>Check out the screenshot below or <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com">click here to try it for yourself</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.universitytutor.com"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/02/universitytutor-screen21.gif" alt="universitytutor.com screenshot map based tutor search" /></a></p>

<p>As you might recall, in the past I was using <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-use-domain-names-to-improve-your-google-rankings/">subdomains for each city</a> to help people narrow their search.  So people looking for tutors in New York City would visit <a href="http://newyork.universitytutor.com">http://newyork.universitytutor.com</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an <a href="http://newyork.universitytutor.com/">example</a> of what it looked like:</p>

<p><a href="http://newyork.universitytutor.com/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/02/universitytutor-screenshot1.gif" alt="universitytutor.com screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>It was more difficult to find tutors near you with this method.  And it also had the unfortunate side affect that many metropolitan areas (which really should have been grouped under one subdomain) were spread out across multiple subdomains.  With 1,600 cities in the database, I would have taken me months to figure out how to group them via endless googling.  And even then it wouldn&#8217;t have worked very well, because you still wouldn&#8217;t have been able to search by zip code or street address, etc.</p>

<p>However, this old method did have an important SEO benefit because Google could index these pages better.  They are largely text and having the city name as a keyword in the subdomain gave a huge boost in my rankings.  This was currently driving about 500 people per day to the site (for free) just from search engine traffic alone.  I obviously didn&#8217;t want to lose this benefit by switching to a largly AJAX &amp; image based site.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t know, Google has a tough time reading image based sites and figuring out what they are about so they tend to rank lower in search engines, everything else being equal.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/02/picture-91.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/02/picture-91.png" alt="UniversityTutor.com search engine traffic" /></a></p>

<p>So I decided to do both.  I would keep the subdomain sites with their text content which were already ranking well in search engines.  And I would set the homepage to use the new map based searching feature.  I&#8217;ll probably put a big link on the subdomain sites to the &#8220;new map based view&#8221; so that people who come there from the search engine find out about the main site and hopefully bookmark it or remember it for next time.</p>

<p><strong>Next steps?  Keep evolving the business model!</strong></p>

<p>The next step I&#8217;ve been thinking about is setting up a way for tutors to invoice clients and get paid through the website (right now they handle all payment with the client on their own via cash or check).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-evolution-of-a-business-model-never-stop-testing/">current business model</a> of offering a free trial and then asking tutors to upgrade to a monthly subscription is working fairly well (about 20% of tutors who go through the free trial end up subscribing for $10/month).</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s still a tough sell and 80% of people don&#8217;t do it.  I&#8217;ve discovered that people are psychologically very resistant to &#8220;paying&#8221; for a job (a job is supposed to pay <em>you</em> right).  It smacks of a scam or some other internet scheme.  Some universities have even refused to list my tutoring positions after seeing that tutors are charged a fee.</p>

<p>Yet people seem to be perfectly happy giving up a small percentage of earned money through a transaction fee.  They have no risk to try it up front, and I only get paid if they get paid.  It doesn&#8217;t FEEL like their money since they are just getting it (minus my fee) whereas ten bucks up front definitely FEELS like their money coming out of their account.</p>

<p>The other day I was checking out Guru.com&#8217;s business model and I think they may have nailed it.  For new users who just want to try out the site for the first time there is zero monthly fee.  It is a totally &#8220;free account&#8221; with no time limit or anything.  For this they take 10% of any money you make.  But at the same time, if you start earning a lot of money through the site and want to pay a smaller percentage then you can pay a small monthly fee (about $10/month) and the percentage drops to just 5%.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/02/picture-101.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/02/picture-101.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>To me this sounds like the right balance.  My guess is that the 20% of people who I&#8217;m getting to sign up right now are the same 20% who would upgrade to the &#8220;pro account&#8221; for $10/month.  And the other 80% (who I&#8217;m earning zero from right now and quickly get kicked out of my site when their free trial ends) are the casual users who would continue using the site and pay the 10% fee.</p>

<p><strong>Won&#8217;t People Pay Offline To Avoid The Transaction Fee?</strong></p>

<p>Probably my biggest concern with this model (and the only reason I hadn&#8217;t thought about trying it until now) was the fear that people would just pay offline (under the table) to avoid the fee.</p>

<p>But I got a clue from Guru.com on this as well.  Here is how they do it: the ONLY way to get reviews and build your experience on their site is to complete the transaction through their site.</p>

<p>Obviously, people are less likely to hire you for jobs if your profile on the site shows that you are brand new and have never done any work there before.  But more experienced service providers can charge higher rates.  This was a big key: show the number of hours this person has completed through your site as an indicator of their experience.  And also only allow clients to leave reviews AFTER they&#8217;ve completed a transaction through your site.  A tutor with several positive reviews and 50 hours of tutoring completed would be able to charge a lot more.  Hopefully enough to make it worth it for them to complete the transaction through my site.</p>

<p>What do you think?  Will it work?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be looking into this and testing it out.  As always, I&#8217;ll share with you how it goes and keep you updated!</p>

<p>Finally, it sure feels great to be working <strong>on</strong> my business instead of <strong>in</strong> it.  I was watching this lady have lunch today and it was obvious she was on her lunch break from Office Depot.  She looked so drained, savoring every moment of her lunch break.  I could just tell she must have been bored out of her mind stuck in that store all day working <strong>in</strong> a business.  It made me realize how lucky I am.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!
