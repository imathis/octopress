<div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Hi Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I have been a long time RSS subscriber to your blog (since the 30 day marketing series – I guess it worked) and I would really appreciate your input on something. A little bit of background first: I am 24 year old software developer in New York City making $120k/year. I paid off all my school loans and do not have any debt. Professionally, I like what I do. It’s interesting work, and it pays damn good money. But, I also want to “break free”.</p>

<p>I have been reading your articles for some time, and the way that I see it, they mainly focus on how to convert time into passive income while using a nominal amount of capital. I’m coming from the other side of the spectrum. I have plenty of capital (I should have around $50k in the bank or in minor investments by the end of the year), but very little time. There are plenty of books and articles which talk about finding good real estate deals or starting businesses, but all those things require time. I have not been able to find anything really useful that investigates the possibilities from the other side of the fence. There is always the stock market, but with the current economic conditions, I am not quite sure that is the best option. Real estate is the other option, but that has also come to a standstill in this economy.</p>

<p>What do you think I should do? I feel that for me, personally, trying to convert my earned income into passive income is the way to go. I am perfectly content to save and invest $50k a year at a good return rate for several years. The question is, what is the best starting point?</p>

<p>Thanks,
A</p>

<p>Hi A,</p>

<p>I think you&#8217;re right, if you have lots of capital then no need to start your own business if you don&#8217;t want to.  You can invest this wisely!  Real estate is by far my favorite here because it generates cash flow (money you can actually spend each month) instead of just capital gains.  I hate stocks.  Plus income from real estate is largely tax free.  Also, you are right that the real estate market has slowed - but this does not mean it&#8217;s a bad time to invest.  When home prices are depreciated its a great time to buy (and not to sell).  So there are two sides to this, no matter which way the market swings it&#8217;s not a bad time for real estate necessarily, it&#8217;s either a bad time to buy or a bad time to sell but not both.</p>

<p>Also, when people are unable to purchase houses they have to rent, so home prices and rents are inversely correlated.  You can ride out any recession in real estate if you keep your properties rented out and they cash flow each month&#8230;you might have huge capital gain shifts during this time but it doesn&#8217;t matter because they are generating income you can spend every month.  Then when the market shifts the other way and prices are inflated, you can sell at the perfect moment.</p>

<p>Real estate is by no means risk free and there are probably 100 ways to lose money doing it (like buying speculative investments - high end town homes, new construction/development, flipping, etc) and I have lost money on some deals.  But there is also a safer way to do it and it takes some learning just like anything else.  Buying foreclosed 3/2/2 starter homes at a steep discount and renting them, for example, and possibly eventually doing bigger deals with apartments that are more hands off, etc.  If you want to go this route, my suggestion is to read some of those books (Rich Dad Poor Dad, The Automatic Millionaire Homeowner, etc), join some local real estate investment clubs to get around the right people, and find a good mentor (someone who has already done this and is RICH, not someone who is still learning).</p>

<p>Btw, not sure I answered your question about real estate taking time.  Yes, investing in single family homes will take time both to find the deals and keep them rented.  But maybe not as much as you&#8217;d think, lots of people do this with a full time job for example.  I spend about 3-4 hours per month dealing with my 3 houses although they took a lot of time up front to get going.  Once you get into bigger real estate deals, for example being a passive investor in a multi-family deal, you can be completely hands off but this can require larger sums of money (around $100k or so) and I don&#8217;t have much experience there.</p>

<p>Millionaires own lots of real estate and they are a great source of passive income!</p>

<p>Hope that helps,
Brian Armstrong</p>
