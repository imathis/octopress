  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-11.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-11-150x150.jpg" alt="How To Analyze A Killer Real Estate Deal" /></a>Today I want to tell you about a real estate deal I&#8217;m working on, and how I analyzed it.</p>

<p>First, I set up a <a href="http://search.har.com/MyHomeFinder/dispLogin.cfm">saved search</a> on my local <a href="http://www.har.com">MLS website</a> (your city probably has one too).  In the search I told it to let me know about all 3 bedroom 2 bath houses that were less than $85,000 and more than 1,888 sq.ft.</p>

<p>Why do that?  Because 85,000/1,888 = $45.  I was telling it to let me know about every house that was $45 per square foot or less, meaning cheap and usually not in great shape.  I wanted to find a foreclosed house that was selling for 60 or 70 cents on the dollar so that I could fix it up.</p>

<p>The saved search notifies you each time a new home fitting that description is listed, and yesterday it sent me list of about five homes.</p>

<p>For each of those five properties, I wanted to answer three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How much could this home sell for if I fixed it up?</p></li>
<li><p>How much could I rent it for and would it cash flow?</p></li>
<li><p>How much will it cost to fix it up?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>To answer these questions, I used a tool called <a href="http://www.lifestylesquest.com/">Quest</a> which generated the screen shots below, but if you don&#8217;t want to pay for Quest you can also do this type of analysis yourself by manually searching through your MLS and putting the data into Excel.</p>

<p><strong>1. How much could this home sell for if I fixed it up?</strong></p>

<p>This particular house I was looking at had an asking price of $76,000 and was 2181 square feet ($34/sq.ft.).  To answer the first question I sought to find comparable homes (&#8220;comps&#8221;).  A good comp is one that has the same number of beds and bath, is about the same size, is in the same neighborhood, was build in about the same year, and was sold in the past 12 months or so.  If you can find similar houses that sold recently, you can be fairly confident that your house will sell for about the same price.  Other foreclosure properties are not good comps; you want to find homes that are in good shape and represent what yours will eventually look like after its fixed up.</p>

<p>Here are the comps I found which show an estimated value of the property of about $116,000.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/sales-comps91.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/sales-comps91-150x150.png" alt="Sales Comps" /></a></p>

<p>All the comps are in the same neighborhood, within + or - 250 sq. ft., built within + or - 8 years, 3 bed 2 bath, and sold in the past 12 months.</p>

<p>This is what initially attracted my attention.  With an asking price of $76,000 and a potential sales price of $116,000, there is $40,000 in equity to be earned.  If my repairs cost less than $40,000, I can make some money.</p>

<p><strong>2. How much could I rent it for and would it cash flow?</strong></p>

<p>Just like I can find sales comps to see how much a property would sell for, I can find rental comps to see how much it will rent for.  Similar search criteria can be used.  Here are the 3 rental comps I found:
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/rental-comps2341.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/rental-comps2341-150x135.png" alt="Rental Comps" /></a></p>

<p>It looks like it could rent for about $1100 per month.  I now have enough information to calculate the potential cash flow (for now I have to assume that the repairs will be about $10,000, but I&#8217;ll investigate this further in the next step).
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/cash-flow871.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/cash-flow871-150x150.png" alt="Cash Flow" /></a></p>

<p>$243/month is the estimate for cash flow.  And the deal could get $29,000 in equity.  Not bad!</p>

<p>Note that I&#8217;m doing a zero down deal here.  The lender I&#8217;m working with will loan 80% of the after repair value.  So if it does get to $116,000 as I hope it will, they will loan me up to 80% * 116,000 = $92,800 to purchase the property and do the repairs.</p>

<p>Doing a zero down deal might not be available to everyone, but even if you needed to put 10% down on the property, the numbers still look pretty good.</p>

<p><strong>3. How much will it cost to fix it up?</strong></p>

<p>With just the information I&#8217;ve collected so far, I&#8217;d feel comfortable making an offer on this property, even without seeing it in person.  It has plenty of equity, and appears to cash flow; this deal probably won&#8217;t last long!  If I couldn&#8217;t schedule any time to see the property for a few days, I&#8217;d most likely submit an offer sight unseen to tie up the deal.</p>

<p>Some people freak out about making an offer sight unseen, but I can always back out later by using an &#8220;option period&#8221;.  For about $100 I could get an option to buy the property in the next week which would give me more time to investigate the repair cost, and allow me to back out just in case the repairs were way more than I thought.  Making an offer doesn&#8217;t mean I have to fully commit to buying it, but I don&#8217;t want anyone else to get it first.</p>

<p>However, I was lucky in this case in that i had some free time in the afternoon and the property was fairly close to where I live.  I decided to go by and take a look before making the offer.</p>

<p>On the way I called the listing real estate agent to see if someone could be there to show the property or if they&#8217;d give me the lock box combination, but it was a no go on such short notice.  Luckily, just as I was hoping, the back door was open (this happens surprisingly often on foreclosure properties, the sliding glass doors or locks are often broken).  So I was able to sneak inside to take a peak ;)</p>

<p>The kitchen was in decent shape except that the microwave had been torn out.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-51.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-51-150x150.jpg" alt="Kithen" /></a></p>

<p>These pictures don&#8217;t due justice, but the carpets and walls were pretty filthy.  The occasional busted light fixture highlighted the place.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-31.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-31-150x150.jpg" alt="Light Fixture, Walls, Carpet" /></a></p>

<p>The yard was generally overgrown and there was some standing water in one corner (perhaps poor drainage or a broken pipe).
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-61.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-61-150x150.jpg" alt="Back Yard" /></a></p>

<p>Oh yeah, and the AC unit was completely busted (there were literally pieces falling off on the ground).  There was also one wall with some exposed 2x4&#8217;s that need to be fixed.</p>

<p>Overall, these pictures make it look better than it really was, but still&#8230;the damage was cosmetic.  New carpet, paint, microwave, AC, and repairing that one wall&#8230;and this place was going to look great.  I think painting the garage door white would improve the curb appeal as well.</p>

<p>My repair estimate of $10,000 was probably about right.  Maybe $15,000 if things got worse.  I could call in a contractor for a free estimate, but based on other estimates I&#8217;ve gotten on similar properties I feel pretty good about the repair cost.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and made the offer.  Cash flowing $200 per month, and pulling $29,000 out of this deal after it was fixed up would feel pretty good.  If my offer is accepted I&#8217;ll call in an inspector before committing to buy.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for future updates!</p>
