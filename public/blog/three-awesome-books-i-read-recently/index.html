  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read a bunch of books over the last 3-4 months.  Many of them were unremarkable, others were pretty good, and three were really outstanding.</p>

<p>Here is a quick write up on the three outstanding ones.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393316041?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393316041">1. Surely You&#8217;re Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character) - by Richard Feynman</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393316041?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393316041"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-02-28-at-11.38.39-PM.png" alt="" /></a>
This is an auto-biography of Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winning scientist, who worked on the atom bomb in the 40&#8217;s (amongst other things).  From that description alone I thought it might be a pretty academic book, but I was totally wrong.</p>

<p>It was at times laugh out loud funny, and other times made me want to cry.  It&#8217;s basically just a collection of funny stories from his life, from pranks he used to pull while at MIT, to how he learned to pick up women in bars, to how the army mistakenly diagnosed him as mentally insane, to how he learned to pick the locks on safes containing national secrets for fun.</p>

<p>I think what I liked about this book is that it is a great model for how to live life - he always stayed curious.  Here you have a brilliant guy, by any measure, but you can see how he deals with adversity and setbacks, and learns to just appreciate the little things in life.  He was a renaissance man also, having lived abroad for years in Brazil (a trip which reminded me of my time in Argentina) and he made an effort to learn from many fields outside of physics (art, music, etc).  I was actually really sad when I finished this book because I was starting to look forward to reading it every night.  It just&#8230;made me happy.  A book hasn&#8217;t done that for me in a long, long time.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596006624">2. Hacker and Painters: Big Ideas From The Computer Age - by Paul Graham</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596006624"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-02-28-at-11.39.53-PM.png" alt="" /></a>
One way to judge a book is by how many &#8220;holy shit&#8221; moments you have when reading it.  A &#8220;holy shit&#8221; moment is when something clicks in your head - a connection you hadn&#8217;t seen before, an articulation of an idea that you always knew to be true but couldn&#8217;t quite put into words, etc.  A moment that gives you a new perspective on life, and often a practical way you can change something in your life (or business) for the better.  A good book for me might have two or three &#8220;holy shit&#8221; moments buried in the pages and you have to read the whole book to find them.  Hackers and Painters was averaging about one of these <strong>per page</strong> at times.</p>

<p>The first half of the book is the best.  The collection of essays cover a variety of topics from education to building wealth.  They are deep and fascinating.   Paul Graham is turning into one of my favorite writers.  The writing style of the book is actually similar to Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s The Tipping Point and his other books.  I&#8217;m actually really surprised after reading Hackers and Painters that it isn&#8217;t more famous than The Tipping Point or a book like that, because I think it&#8217;s actually better in many ways.  On thing is for sure, Paul Graham is the MASTER of analogies (summing up an idea by comparing it to an similar one that everyone can relate to) - he uses them liberally and they are very effective in driving his point home.</p>

<p>The second half of the book gets into some more nerdy topics related to computer programming which may not be as interesting to most audiences.  Even as a certified computer science super-nerd I found these slightly less interesting.  But the first half of the book alone makes it worth reading.  I recently got to (sort-of) meet Paul Graham in person at a recent Y-Combinator event, so that was pretty sweet.</p>

<p>If there is an overarching theme to this book (a big if, given the scope) it is to compare the current technology renaissance in Silicon Valley to the 15th century artistic renaissance in Florence, and how they both changed the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452011876?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0452011876"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-02-28-at-11.41.11-PM.png" alt="" /></a>
I decided to read this book after listening to an interview with Jimmy Wales (the founder of Wikipedia) where he described this as one of the books that most influenced him.</p>

<p>It did not disappoint.  On the one hand this book is a masterful piece of fiction that can hold its own amongst the best.  Ayn Rand&#8217;s writing is like poetry at times (albeit 1,000 pages of it) as she beautifully describes the interaction between characters.  To top it off, the main character, Dagny Taggart, is possibly the strongest (and sexiest) female character I have ever come across in fiction.  The fact this was written in the 50&#8217;s makes it even more impressive.</p>

<p>But the book is not famous for being a work of fiction.  It has a very strong motive underneath: to convince you of something important (and controversial) about how the world works.  I won&#8217;t give away exactly what it is - that would spoil the surprise of reading it - but there is no doubt this book is polarizing.  People typically come away either absolutely loving it or absolutely hating it.</p>

<p>I definitely came out more in the former camp of loving it, but I needed little convincing about its message.  The book is not without its faults either - there is a rather preachy diatribe toward the end which I thought was a bit long winded, and at 1,000 pages it certainly isn&#8217;t an easy read.  Also, Rand&#8217;s philosophical roots show through in her arguments at times which could be viewed as overly-intellectual (and thus unconvincing) by some audiences.  But given the number of people who list this amongst their favorite (and most influential) books of all time, I think it&#8217;s something everyone should read.</p>

<p>The weird thing is that this book seems to change you permanently after reading it.  It&#8217;s almost like being able to &#8220;see the matrix&#8221; after reading it (just as Neo did in the movie) because it gives you a new lens through which to see the world.  For weeks (and now months) after reading this I keep thinking about it as I overheard little pieces of conversation or discussions on the radio.  I also feel like I have entered a secret society of people who have read (and subscribe to the ideals of) this book.  They identify each other discreetly, but we know who each other are when we cross paths.</p>

<p>Anyway, check them out and let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!
