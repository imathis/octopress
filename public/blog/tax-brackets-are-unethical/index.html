<div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason at the gym last night I started thinking about tax brackets and how totally ridiculous they are.</p>

<p>Sure, I understand the idea that &#8220;people who make more should contribute more in taxes&#8221;, but do you realize this is already accomplished with a simple percentage?  Let&#8217;s say everyone paid 20% of their income to the government and this was the only tax bracket.  Well, 20% of $50,000 is half as much as 20% of $100,000.  It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s fair - someone who earned twice as much would contribute twice as much in taxes.</p>

<p>But instead, we have tax brackets.  We are in effect telling people that if you work hard, start businesses, own real estate, break free, create jobs,  stimulate the economy, and start to earn a lot of money - we (the government) will punish you by taking an even greater percentage of your money.  Similarly, if aren&#8217;t doing anything currently which people are willing to highly compensate you for - you will be rewarded by the government taking less of your money!  How is this any different than punishing success and rewarding failure?</p>

<p><strong>The dirty little secret about tax brackets</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a more subtle point that many people don&#8217;t realize.  Due to tax brackets and inflation, the government will continually get more of your money even without raising taxes.  Allow me to explain&#8230;</p>

<p>Inflation occurs each year and makes your money worth a little bit less.  Many companies give a standard raise each year of about 3% to each of their employees if they haven&#8217;t done anything particularly spectacular or terrible because it is expected.  This raise doesn&#8217;t actually make them any richer in term of purchasing power - they can still buy about the same amount of stuff they bought last year because everything is a little more expensive.</p>

<p>BUT, while salaries are continually creeping up due to inflation (without anyone getting richer), tax brackets don&#8217;t creep up with inflation.  They stay set.  That means there are millions of Americans each year who get bumped into a higher tax bracket (without being any richer) just due to inflation - and the government gets a bigger percentage of their money.</p>

<p>This means politicians can literally say &#8220;I will not raise taxes!&#8221; yet still get more of your money even after adjusting for inflation.  Tricky!</p>

<p><strong>A problem of marketing</strong></p>

<p>Getting widespread adoption of an idea like this strikes me as primarily a marketing problem.  This concept of no tax brackets is currently known as a &#8220;flat tax&#8221;.  They need to come up with a better name for it because the name suggests &#8220;no matter how much you earn you will pay the same amount in taxes&#8221;.  This sounds totally unfair - and of course is not at all how it works (as I mentioned above, under a flat tax someone who makes twice as much would pay twice as much in taxes).  But that&#8217;s certainly how it sounded to me when I first heard it.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d have to make the distinction between the <em>percentage</em> being the same while the <em>actual dollar amount</em> of taxes you pay changes drastically.  Unfortunately, I&#8217;d venture to guess that a relatively small percentage of the population TRULY understands this concept to the point where it wouldn&#8217;t bias them.</p>

<p>Just like the &#8220;estate tax&#8221; never had widespread opposition until they started calling it the &#8220;death tax&#8221;, I think the &#8220;flat tax&#8221; needs a name change.  I&#8217;m not sure what it would be (the &#8220;fair tax&#8221;?  the &#8220;let&#8217;s not discourage success and be idiots tax&#8221;?).  Who knows, all I know is that I can&#8217;t think of any real justification for having tax brackets and it seems totally unethical.</p>

<p>I should also mention that I am currently in a pretty low tax bracket and have nothing to gain from a flat tax - in fact I&#8217;d probably end up paying more.  I do however work like crazy and hope to some day be filthy rich by contributing massive amounts of value to the world (isn&#8217;t this incentive the very basis of all innovation and progress for mankind?) and it bothers me that this incentive is being undermined.</p>

<p><strong>So what do you think?  Is there any justification for having tax brackets?  Are we just rewarding failure and punishing success?</strong></p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!
