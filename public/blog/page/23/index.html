<time datetime="2008-05-16T14:53:32-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 16<span>th</span>, 2008</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people who want to start their own business don&#8217;t have a ton of money laying around and it&#8217;s probably one the most common questions I get emailed about:  How can I get started without a lot of cash?</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;ve put together a list below of the best ideas I&#8217;ve heard and personally used.  I hope you find it useful!</p>

<p>The three basic strategies to starting a business without much money are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Delay the normal &#8220;business starting&#8221; activities like incorporating, hiring, renting office or retail space, etc until AFTER your business has started earning money.  This is known as bootstrapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing everything yourself and spending your personal time instead of hiring an expert. (Takes longer but costs less.)</p></li>
<li><p>Using some neat tricks and little known deals below.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Start With The Easy Stuff: Eliminate Expenses</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t rent an office! - work from home. Or better yet work from the best free office with locations everywhere: Starbucks.  If you need to meet with a client and are worried about seeming small time without an office, don&#8217;t be.  Just meet them at a restaurant for a lunch meeting.  This is what people with the nicest offices do anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t hire any employees! - do it all yourself until you have some $ coming in the door.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t hire lawyers, technical people, graphic designers, or assistants (see below)</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Legal Stuff and Incorporating</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Get a free lawyer and legal advice from the mentors at <a href="http://www.score.org">Score.org</a></p></li>
<li><p>Find a website with a similar legal document and modify it to your needs</p></li>
<li><p>An LLC is probably the best business structure, but don&#8217;t worry about incorporating until you&#8217;re earning money, just do a sole proprietorship, you can always incorporate later (you can get it setup with the IRS in just a few minutes by calling them at 800-829-4933)</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-and-create-a-personal-financial-statement-each-month-in-5-minutes/">do your own financial statements</a> for your business in Excel instead of hiring a CPA or bookkeeper (again you can do this after you&#8217;re making money)</p></li>
<li><p>Take a Quickbooks class at your local community college</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Make a website for your business</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t pay a premium for a top end domain name, there are <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-choose-a-killer-domain-name-for-your-business/">plenty of good ones left</a></p></li>
<li><p>Test out your ideas by writing to a blog, you&#8217;ll get feedback on what people like and don&#8217;t like</p></li>
<li><p>Get a free business website at <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">www.wordpress.com</a> or <a href="http://tumblr.com/">tumblr.com</a>.  It won&#8217;t be your own domain (it will be something like yourbusiness.wordpress.com) but&#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>When you&#8217;re ready to have your own domain, register it at <a href="http://www.domain.com/">domain.com</a> and add this as a custom domain to your Wordpress or Tumblr site.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a <a href="http://themes.wordpress.net/">professional website design for free</a> with a wordpress theme that you can install with a few clicks (no programming knowledge needed)</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Getting a Logo</h3>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t hire a fancy graphic designer.  At least not yet.  Use LogoYes to <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/logoyes">create your own logo</a> (or at least get ideas that you can recreate on your own for free)</li>
</ol>


<h3>Accepting Credit Cards</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t bother with a full merchant account to start off with, they are complicated, come with monthly feeds, and require programming expertise.  Instead try a simpler (and much cheaper) solution like <a href="http://checkout.google.com">Google Checkout</a> or <a href="http://www.paypal.com">Paypal</a></p></li>
<li><p>For a more professional look and a complete shopping cart for only $5/month use <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/e-junkie">E-Junkie</a>, its great and I use it on this site</p></li>
<li><p>If you have lots of physical products, try a <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce/">Yahoo Store</a></p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Starting a service business where you consult, coach, teach, etc</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Create several pages on your <a href="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress</a> site: one for your experience, testimonials, rates, availability, etc</p></li>
<li><p>Pick a domain name with your #1 keyword in it!  (Assuming it isn&#8217;t a very competitive keyword you&#8217;ll rank on the first page of google within a month or two for that keyword which means customers!) <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-use-domain-names-to-improve-your-google-rankings/">here&#8217;s some more info and an example</a></p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Creating Info Products</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Use an ebook template like <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/eBookTemplates.zip">these</a> from <a href="http://www.gurumastermind.com/">Eben Pagan</a></p></li>
<li><p>For print books, self publish it at <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">www.lulu.com</a> and use print on demand (they don&#8217;t print a single book until someone buys it which means you have zero up front cost for inventory!)</p></li>
<li><p>Use a $20 <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/webcam">webcam</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=digital%20camera&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;index=blended&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">digital camera</a> to create educational video products</p></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTechSmith-CAMS01-Camtasia-Studio-5-1%2Fdp%2FB000HCW6YE%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dsoftware%26qid%3D1210795862%26sr%3D8-2&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">camtasia</a> ( $200 for PC) or <a href="http://www.shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html">iShowU</a> ($20 for Mac) to record your screen and make great videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7z0XOjjvqw">like this one</a>.  Or record powerpoints and do the voiceover to make great educational products.  <strong>Update</strong>:  even cheaper use <a href="http://www.screentoaster.com/">ScreenToaster</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a mac to edit your videos (iMovie is free) and you can even produce DVD&#8217;s</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Before investing in a retail location&#8230;</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to a local fair or festival and rent a booth to see if anyone buys your product.  Talk to potential customers and get feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Try selling it on ebay</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Always be learning about business</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to a <a href="http://www.meetup.com">meetup.com</a> groups in your city related to business/entrepreneurship</p></li>
<li><p>Read all the best business books by getting them from the library</p></li>
<li><p>Get <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/subscribe/">3 of the top 10 books on building wealth</a> for free in PDF</p></li>
<li><p>Make friends with other entrepreneurs and share material</p></li>
<li><p>Install the <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">stumble upon</a> toolbar and choose business/entrepreneurship as one of your interests to find all the best videos and talks out there (this is literally like going to a free semester of business school, you get to see all the best speakers and thinkers of our time, and those of the past)</p></li>
<li><p>Read blogs like this one in <a href="http://reader.google.com">google reader</a></p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Marketing, free website traffic, and getting your first customer</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Get <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/vista">250 full-color business cards</a> for free to hand out to people you meet</p></li>
<li><p>Post an offer on <a href="http://www.craigslist.com">craigslist</a></p></li>
<li><p>Post <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=addXWGFZfNg">videos</a> on <a href="http://www.youtube.com">youtube</a> with links to your website</p></li>
<li><p>Post the same video to all video sharing sites (Google Video, Yahoo Video, MySpace, Revver, etc) at once with <a href="http://www.tubemogul.com/">TubeMogul</a> (this is some of the best free marketing you can do)</p></li>
<li><p>Generate leads by offering an incentive on your website for people to give you their contact info (some incentives that work well: Top 10 reports like the top 10 myths about&#8230;the top 10 thing you should know before&#8230;etc, videos, audio interviews, one page cheat sheets, free ebooks)</p></li>
<li><p>Write a <a href="http://www.youngmoney.com/entrepreneur/advice/41">good article</a> and send it to more popular websites (include your byline at the bottom).  This is also known as doing guest posts and is the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/conclusion/">#1 thing I used to grow this blog</a> when it first started out.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/dgga">how to use google adwords</a> and spend $10 and see if it brings in at least $10 (if so keep going!)</p></li>
<li><p>If you can&#8217;t afford to get links from expensive directories like Yahoo ($299) use <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/ds">Directory Submitter</a> to get links from hundreds of smaller directories for free</p></li>
<li><p>Pick a good domain name with your keywords in the domain (use hyphens if necessary).  This will help you rank in Google for that keyword and get visitors to your website.</p></li>
<li><p>Do some basic <a href="http://www.webconfs.com/15-minute-seo.php">on page SEO</a></p></li>
<li><p>Research what keywords will bring you the most traffic (and are least competitive) with <a href="http://keyworddiscovery.com/search.html">keyword discovery</a>, <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/wtfree">Wordtracker&#8217;s Free Service</a>, and (probably the best option) <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/wt">WordTrackers free trial</a> of their full service (just have to remember to cancel within 7 days to not get charged!)</p></li>
<li><p>See which keywords are <a href="http://adlab.msn.com/Online-Commercial-Intention/OCI.aspx">likely to bring buyers</a> (instead of tire kickers)</p></li>
<li><p>Get more incoming links to your site by creating a <a href="http://www.squidoo.com">Squidoo</a> page (these rank very high in the search engines for some reason!)</p></li>
<li><p>Send an email to everyone in your email program&#8217;s contact list with a short friendly note letting them know you are starting a business and ask if they could forward it to just one or two people who might be interested.  Offer something free for the first 10 people.  This has an exponential effect because it not only reaches who you know, but everyone who knows who you know (an order of magnitude bigger group of people.)</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a guest post by <a href="http://www.manuelzeh.de">Manuel Zeh</a>, a friend of mine who has been travelling the world for 7 years and has come to some interesting perspectives on life.  Manuel has travelled 40 countries on all continents and lived in 10 of them. He speaks 9 languages and is a professional pianist who has performed on Indonesian TV, at the Sydney Opera House and on the cruise ship &#8220;Sun Princess&#8221;, among others. He currently lives in Tokyo, Japan.  Take a minute to check out his website at: <a href="http://www.manuelzeh.de">www.manuelzeh.de</a></p>

<h3>1. Retirement is NOT the goal of the game.</h3>

<p>I used to think I want to work <em>really</em> hard so I could retire <em>really</em> early&#8230; when I suddenly realized that I wasn&#8217;t living life to the fullest now, while I&#8217;m still young. In a way, &#8220;working&#8221; means putting a price tag on your time, and selling it - and I believe my young years are priceless&#8230; they never come back. Yes, plan for later&#8230; but live in the present. The &#8220;now&#8221; is the only time we really have, and life is not a race, in which &#8220;whoever dies first, wins&#8221;. Statistics show that many people die soon after retirement, because they don&#8217;t have a purpose to live for anymore&#8230; other studies show that people who never HAVE to work again at an early age usually start to work HARDER then before, because that&#8217;s when they start doing what they love. Do these things you love NOW&#8230; they are likely your true calling. </p>

<h3>2. Salary is NOT a good criteria to choose a job</h3>

<p>Many people choose a job based on how much money they will make. Consider this&#8230; you spend MOST of your waking hours in your job - and life is made up of time, not money. Make your jobs something you love doing and you&#8217;ll never have to work a single day of your life! I believe the best three criteria to choose a career path are: - something you love doing and are passionate about - something that contributes / is useful - something you have a talent for If you fulfill these three criteria and learn how to market yourself, the money will follow&#8230; and you&#8217;ll be loving every minute of it.</p>

<h3>3. A fun life full of experiences and achievement are NOT mutually exclusive</h3>

<p>When I started travelling the world 7 years ago, I used to think that you have a choice to either ACHIEVE a lot or to EXPERIENCE a lot&#8230; and I consciously chose the latter. I&#8217;ve since found that if you follow your heart and your passions, things just fall into place and you&#8217;ll end up achieving a lot as a by product. Sometimes I&#8217;m surprised when I look at my CV and how impressed many people are by it, even though (or maybe because!) I&#8217;ve spent the better part of a decade travelling and having the most amazing life I could have dreamt up for myself. </p>

<h3>4. Your parents do NOT always know what is best for you</h3>

<p>Once I was dating a girl who, when she was 19, had wanted to travel. But she succumbed to family and society pressure and went with the responsible, financially secure choice instead. She went to uni, postponing her travels and became a dentist. When I met her, she was 26 and almost done studying&#8230; and she realized that she doesn&#8217;t even want to be a dentist, but it was too late. She also realized that she couldn&#8217;t really travel anymore because at 26 you&#8217;re not as free as at 19&#8230; she was already tied up with career, family duties, bills, a relationship, and so forth. I firmly believe that, if she had travelled at 19, she would have found herself. She would have discovered her true identity and what she really wants in life, instead of taking on a profession that she&#8217;d end up resenting. She would probably also have been a lot more motivated during university&#8230; studying with the serenity of knowing that she has already lived out her dreams, and that she&#8217;s pursuing a career she loves. </p>

<h3>5.You do NOT need to be rich to travel the world</h3>

<p>If a week in Florida can easily cost a few thousand dollars&#8230; how much is it to travel the whole WORLD for many YEARS? People sometimes ask me whether I&#8217;m a millionaire. Far from it&#8230; the formula is, I work in first world countries and save up. Travel in 3rd world countries. Latin America, Africa and Asia are ridiculously cheap&#8230; whereas in Europe, North America, Australia, Singapore, Japan and South Korea, you can make very good money. But there are many different ways to travel&#8230; most recently I worked on a cruise ship. Good salary, no tax, free food and accommodation, access to all the pools, gyms etc on board, lots of free time, travel in the South Sea on a pay check, and free excursions to all the islands.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t come to the end of your life regretting the things you did NOT do&#8230; don&#8217;t dream your life, live your dream!
My best to you all,</p>

<p>Manuel Zeh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey Folks,</p>

<p>This is going to be my first video blog.  I&#8217;m trying out a new format.  Please let me know which one you like better (written or video) in the comments!</p>

<p>**A couple things I noticed on the video that I think could be improved:  I&#8217;d like to keep it shorter and denser with information.  Also I realized that I never sound very EXCITING when I talk.  I think doing more video blogs over time I&#8217;ll get better.  Probably a combination of video and some written outline or graphs could be a good combination.  Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Here is the written equivalent&#8230;**</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve practiced this for a long time myself, but it just occurred to me again the other day and I thought I&#8217;d post about it: in general the mainstream news (television, radio, and print) is an utter waste of your time.  And worse than that, it&#8217;s probably preventing you from becoming successful.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>1. The News Is Full of Negative Stuff</strong></p>

<p>The old saying in media is true that &#8220;if it bleeds it leads&#8221;.  The news tends to overreport negative events like murders and crashes because it gets ratings.  You can&#8217;t help but have these things affect you over time, and it slowly but surely starts to make you think the city is dangerous, or that the world is hostile, or that opportunity isn&#8217;t out there.  All of course are incorrect, but whatever you spend time watching and reading becomes your reality.</p>

<p><strong>2. The News Is Designed To Scare You As Entertainment</strong></p>

<p>The story of the little girl who was kidnapped is addictive to watch.  It robs you of your time.  The story is designed just like an entertainment show, to keep you hooked waiting for what will happen next.</p>

<p>Some people would say its important to watch this because it gives you valuable safety information.  We can prove to ourselves that this isn&#8217;t true by looking at the statistics.</p>

<p>Statistically, you are very unlikely to get kidnapped, die in a plane crash, or to choke on a small plastic toy.  Yet this is what gets the media attention.  I wrote about this a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">while back</a>, how humans are bad at estimating risk.  After 9/11 many people were scared to fly, and this perception caused about 1.4 million people to drive instead of fly to their holiday destination, effectively killing about 1000 people in additional auto fatalities (you&#8217;re much more likely to be killed in a car crash than a plane crash).</p>

<p>The news isn&#8217;t giving you valuable safety information on things that are likely to kill you (it&#8217;s boring to report on heart disease), its designed to scare and keep you watching.</p>

<p><strong>3. It&#8217;s Biased</strong></p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe it the other day when I accidentally spent a few minutes on Fox News and then on CNN as I flipped through the channels.  Fox news was essentially crucifying Obama while CNN was vigorously defending him.  Of course not directly, but by the guests and hosts on the show.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe how blatant it was.  In theory the news should just report the facts and let us make up our own minds, but they (mainstream media) can&#8217;t even do that today it seems.</p>

<p><strong>4. It&#8217;s For The Most Part, Irrelevant</strong></p>

<p>99% of the stories you see on the news can never, and will never affect your life, period.</p>

<p>The reason is that its tailored to a wide audience.  So you will have to wade through all sorts of junk you don&#8217;t care about that wastes you time to get 1 or 2 nuggets of useful information.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>

<p>So if mainstream news is a colossal waste of time that is polluting your brain with negative thoughts, what is the solution?</p>

<p>The first step is to spend as little time on it as possible.  Reading a book on marketing could make you an extra $100,000 this year whereas watching a show on a tornado 1000 miles away will never affect your life one bit.</p>

<p>So, I spend about 20 seconds (literally) per day reading the news.  This is no joke.</p>

<p>I do it with a new aggregator service that delivers articles to my inbox (I use Yahoo News, but Google News is great too).  I just scan the first 5 headlines or so (they are ordered by importance) and delete.  If I see something that is interesting or could really affect me (which is rare), I read deeper.  This is better for a few reasons&#8230;</p>

<p>Its fast.  With about 20 seconds per day of scanning headlines, you can know enough to know what&#8217;s happening in the world.  At least as much as any reasonable, intelligent person needs to know.</p>

<p>Its unbiased.  News aggregator services send out news based on what is being said in hundreds or thousands of news sources.  You get the most important based on collective thought, not one person&#8217;s agenda.</p>

<p>Its more targeted.  You can get email updates on specific areas like business, sports, or whatever is important to you.</p>

<p>Try it out.  And with all your extra free time you should start reading and watching material that is WAY better than the news.  You should be watching speeches by important innovative leaders in your field, blogs in areas that interest you, and listening to audio books in your car instead of the radio.</p>

<p>In fact, every morning while I&#8217;m eating breakfast I don&#8217;t read the newspaper.  I read blogs (in <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>) like <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin&#8217;s Blog</a>, and <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">The Four Hour Work Week</a> to fill my mind with relevant, though provoking, educational, motivating material.  And then I go take on the day.  Because of this I&#8217;m much more effective during the day than if I&#8217;d started it by watching a story on Britney&#8217;s trip to rehab.  Blogs in many ways are the new unbiased, educational, positive newspapers for successful people I think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://sivers.org/nolimit">Derek Sivers discusses</a> the exact <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/helping-individual-people-cant-make-you-rich/">point I made</a> a few weeks ago (with a much better example than mine)</p>

<blockquote><p>If you sell pens for a living and someone orders a million pens, no problem! You just place an order with your manufacturer for a million pens, get them to the customer, and celebrate.</p></blockquote>

<p>But if you do hands-on massage for a living and a recent spot on Oprah gets you a waiting list of 10,000 people, “you’ll wish you were in the pen business.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/913-question-your-work">This is Why MLM and Network Marketing Don&#8217;t Work</a> - ask yourself these before getting too far into a new business idea</p>

<blockquote><p>Why are we doing this?<br/>
What problem are we solving?<br/>
Is this actually useful?<br/>
Are we adding value?</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://waxy.org/2008/03/abort_retry_or/">Don&#8217;t Listen To Negative People</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m sure that the moment man discovered fire, there was some guy nearby saying, &#8220;Too smoky. Can burn you. Lame.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Sleep: 8 hours
Exercise: 1 hour
Work: 8 hours
Eating: 2 hours (leisurely)
Hygiene: 1 hour
Travel: 1 (Commute, errands)</p></blockquote>

<p>That leaves you three hours for family time, sex, shopping, food preparation, chores, household repair, volunteering in the school, and so on. If you have a dentist appointment, or your talkative relative calls, or American Idol has a two-hour special, you’re tapped out.</p>

<blockquote><p>Five little companies were featured to showcase the owner’s decision to leave their daily rat dace of a life behind and dive into the uncertainty of following their dreams. Here’s the kicker: These 5 companies are some of the most mundane, normal, average little companies out there.</p></blockquote>

<p>These companies aren’t going to beat Google, they aren’t building a better iPod or bread slicer. There’s no “the next Facebook” and not a mention of angel funding. These entrepreneurs are doing simple things they love and making a pretty decent living from it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of the time when we try something new we try to hide it.</p>

<p>We try not to make all the mistakes that we assume new people make.  Once in a while (1 in 100) it works and we stumble upon something that we are a total natural at.</p>

<p>But for almost everything else in life, its pretty obvious that we are no expert the first time we try something.  In fact, most of the time we downright suck at it for at least a year.</p>

<p>When I started doing brazilian jujitsu I was terrible at it.  Every week for about 3 months I would go in and just get tapped out over and over again.  It was pretty discouraging at times.  I remember the first day I actually submitted an opponent (won) after about 3 months.  He had just started and was even more inexperienced than me, and he promptly beat me again in the next round, but still&#8230;I had actually seen a little progress.</p>

<p>This is true for learning marketing, how to start a business, how to play the guitar, go on a date, throw a pitch, or dance salsa.  Pretty much anything worth learning in life is like this.</p>

<p>A lot of people live their entire lives in a perpetual state of mediocrity at everything they want to learn just because they don&#8217;t want to admit to other people that they aren&#8217;t an expert.  They aren&#8217;t ok being bad at something for a while.</p>

<p>They even get defensive if someone gives them advice.  &#8220;Why would you even say what?  I KNOW how to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have the utmost respect a for totally clueless person who at least knows it and is eager to learn.  I&#8217;ve been that person a bunch of times in my life.</p>

<p>But there is nothing more challenging to work with than a totally clueless person who argues with every suggestion.</p>

<p>I heard a cool parable one time about a man who wanted to learn from this old guru who lived on top of a mountain.  He hiked up there, found the man, and told him his desire to learn.  The old man said &#8220;very well, before our first lesson let us sit and have a cup of tea&#8221;.  The old man began to pour the tea into the cup of his visitor.  He kept pouring till it reached the top.  He kept pouring and pouring until the tea had run over and was getting everywhere.  The man leapt up from his chair and cried &#8220;stop! the cup is full!&#8221;  And the guru said, &#8220;your first lesson is to know that I cannot add any more to a cup that is full.  For me to teach you new ideas, you must clear your mind of what you already know&#8221;.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and admit when you&#8217;re clueless.  If you&#8217;re not getting the results you want, let whatever ideas you have go and be willing to try anything that someone who IS getting the results suggests.  You&#8217;re not fooling anyone anyway, they&#8217;ll admire the honesty, and you&#8217;re learning curve will go up drastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything worth doing is worth doing badly at first.&#8221;
