  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a great list of new startups that just came out from the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/silicon-valley-elite-flock-to-y-combinator-demo-day/">Y-Combinator Demo Day</a>.  Definitely worth checking out.  It looks better than normal and there is some amazing work being done there.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me from seeing this list: Web 2.0 entrepreneurs tend to forget that you don&#8217;t actually have a business unless people are willing to part with their hard earned cash to use what you built.  For example, FlightCaster, JobSpice, Bump Technologies, Listia&#8230;.amazing sites, but I can&#8217;t see anyone actually paying money to use these.  If that&#8217;s the case then it&#8217;s not a company, it&#8217;s a project.  Call it what it is.</p>

<p>RentHop.com and HighlightCam.com I can see people paying for.  Why isn&#8217;t RentHop charging anything?  This idea that you can reach critical mass by going free and then suddenly switch to a paid model has been largely shown not to work - it just upsets your base who feel like you&#8217;ve sold out.  If you&#8217;re going to charge for it, you need to do it from day one.  If you aren&#8217;t, then don&#8217;t call it a business - it&#8217;s a charity project where you hope to maybe break even on ad revenue. (Personally, I think RentHop should charge a small listing fee&#8230;it&#8217;s well worth it and I&#8217;d love to see them be successful and expand to other cities.)</p>

<p>RethinkDB.com also looks brilliant, but might work better as an open source product and not a company.  They&#8217;re going to have a big mental hurdle to clear to get people to pay for it when MySQL is free and always has been.</p>

<p>But overall I&#8217;m very impressed and you should take a minute to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/silicon-valley-elite-flock-to-y-combinator-demo-day/">check out all the companies in the article</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is an interesting list of the open source pieces that went into making <a href="http://feedmailpro.com">FeedmailPro.com</a>, in no particular order.  Remarkably, they are all free.  Perhaps what&#8217;s even more remarkable is that I can&#8217;t think of a paid alternative that I&#8217;d rather use in any of these cases, even if it was free.  Open source is great at making reliable code because so many eyeballs get to look at it, tear it apart, and fix weaknesses.  It general, I find it much more reliable than proprietary code.</p>

<p>This list can be a bit intimidating if you&#8217;re new to this stuff.  Don&#8217;t worry, you don&#8217;t need to be an expert in any of these, and in fact <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/slicehost/">Slicehost</a> (where I&#8217;m hosting the app) has a great bunch of tutorials to help you get through installing the first five or so.  For non-technical people&#8230;this may only be interesting as a overview of what goes on behind the scenes, but I thought I&#8217;d post it just the same.</p>

<p><strong>The components:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>
The is the &#8220;web framework&#8221; that I used to make the site.  It provides you with a lot of functionality like creating models (subscribers, feeds, etc) and connecting it all to the database.  Many of the tools listed toward the end are &#8220;plugins&#8221; for Ruby on Rails.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>
This is the database running underneath which stores all the data and makes it permanent.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Linux</a>
This is the operating system for the server hosted with <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/slicehost/">Slicehost.com</a>.  It&#8217;s stable, fast, and memory efficient.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://nginx.net/">Nginx</a>
This is the webserver which takes incoming requests from people&#8217;s web browsers and routes them to my application.  You may have heard of Apache which is a more popular web server.  Nginx is newer on the scene, but I prefer it&#8230;faster and less memory intensive.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger mod_rails</a>
Keeps lots of &#8220;worker&#8221; processes busy on the server processing requests, and spawns new ones if the existing ones can&#8217;t keep up.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>
This is the mail server which handles all sending and receiving of email.  It&#8217;s pretty much the standard in the linux world now and is known for being able to handle extremely high volumes of email.  I&#8217;m not sure what capacity I could get up to on my current server before needing to upgrade, but it&#8217;s probably at least in the millions of emails per day.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.courier-mta.org/">Courier</a>
Handles logins and accounts on the mail server.  I&#8217;ve got accounts for bounces, complaints, unsubscribes, support, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/">DKIM-Milter</a>
This plugin to Postfix &#8220;signs&#8221; outgoing emails to verify they originated from my domain.  This helps them get through some spam filters.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">GIT</a>
This is a &#8220;source control&#8221; system where I keep the code I&#8217;m writing.  It keeps track of versions and history of the files.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.capify.org/index.php/Capistrano">Capistrano</a>
This is used to &#8220;deploy&#8221; code from my development machine to the production server.  There are a number of steps each time you change the code to get it on the server, like shutting down what&#8217;s currently running, cleaning up log files, moving over stuff you want to keep from the last version, starting up the new code, etc.  This lets you do all the steps with one command.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a>
A text editor (and a whole lot more -the fancy word for it is &#8220;integrated development environment&#8221; or IDE) to write the code on my laptop.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>The rest are all plugins for Ruby on Rails:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate">Will_Paginate</a>
This helps you create &#8220;pages&#8221; - just like on google where there is a &#8220;next&#8221;, &#8220;previous&#8221;, 1, 2, 3&#8230;.etc links at the bottom.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master">AuthLogic</a>
Handles the logins, email activation, lost passwords, etc for creating new user accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-openid/">Ruby-OpenID</a>
Let&#8217;s people login with OpenID instead of a email/password.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/grosser/rpx_now/tree/master">rpx_now</a>
Similar to above but also lets people use the fancy RPXNow.com widget with the big buttons for Google, Yahoo, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/tree/master">Feedzirra</a>
Library to quickly parse a lot of RSS or ATOM feeds.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/columbus/tree/master">columbus</a>
Detects RSS feeds on a website.  This lets people type either the RSS feed directly or their blog URL (in which case columbus will &#8220;discover&#8221; the feed URL for them).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/ryanb/uniquify/tree/master">Uniquify</a>
Library to generate those unique &#8220;tokens&#8221; you see on the end of URL&#8217;s.  Like when you click a confirmation link or unsubscribe link, sometimes you&#8217;ll see a list of random characters on the end of it.  This generates those and makes sure there are no duplicates across your system.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://chronic.rubyforge.org/">Chronic</a>
This helps with some of the scheduling where I let people send out emails one per day, or week, or several times per week, etc.  More specifically it converts human readable time (like &#8220;next Thursday&#8221;) into time that a computer can understand.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/javan/whenever/tree/master">Whenever</a>
This helps schedule recurring tasks that happen in the background, like parsing feeds, sending emails, checking for bounced emails, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job/tree/master">delayed_job</a>
This queues tasks to be processed at a later date, such as importing subscribers, or sending mailings.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/alexvollmer/daemon-spawn/tree/master">daemon_spawn</a>
This tool launches delayed_job in the background (or several of them to run at once if there is high volume).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://fastercsv.rubyforge.org/">fastercsv</a>
Handles importing and exporting csv files.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://dist.leetsoft.com/api/paypal/">paypal</a> and <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/money/">money</a> gems
Handles processing of notifications when something happens over at Paypal, like someone subscribes, unsubscribes, sends a payment, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.activemerchant.org/">active_merchant</a>
Communicates with Paypal to send affiliate payments.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://github.com/rails/exception_notification/tree/master">exception notifier</a>
Lets me know when errors occur on the website.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So those are all the pieces (might have missed a few but 27 listed here).  There&#8217;s at least 100,000 lines of code above that I was able to use.  And what did I write?  About 4,000 lines of ruby code that ties it all together.  The user interface is completely new, the models and the logic, but as you can see many of the pieces underneath are modular and can be plugged in to to get the benefit without having to write them from scratch.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen the final product yet, take a second to <a href="http://feedmailpro.com">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re doin it live!</p>

<p>Tonight I&#8217;m launching FeedmailPro!  It&#8217;s been tested in the wild and is performing well after a handful of tweaks over the last week.  Thanks to the folks who beta tested it and have been sending me feedback.  I also added the final features which were needed before launch, namely billing, the affiliate program, and a bunch more spam safe guards (which could be an interesting post in itself).  The site is also running much faster now that I upgraded the server.</p>

<p>This project has been a wild ride.  It was less than 4 weeks ago that this idea even occurred to me.  I was sitting there with no domain name (not even a company name), no billing system, no company bank account, no website, no technology, and not very much knowledge of what would be required.  Now everything is in place - if I can get the first paying customer before 1 month is up that&#8217;ll be a new record (for me at least).</p>

<p>I love how technology has made things easier and easier for entrepreneurs.  Ten years ago this company would have take at least a year to get started.  I was able to plug in dozens of pieces of technology that are powering FeedmailPro and got them all for free.  Open source software is amazing.  Ruby on rails also deserves a shout out for this.  Even the complete billing system and affiliate program are a combination of Paypal and code I wrote previously for UniversityTutor.com.  The mail server components, the web server, etc.  I&#8217;m using code from at LEAST 25 different projects and people to make it all work.  Each would have been it&#8217;s own small project in itself.  Truly amazing.  It would actually be interesting to create a list of all the pieces that went into it.</p>

<p><strong>The Affiliate Program</strong></p>

<p>Ok here&#8217;s how you can participate in the launch and earn a bunch of money doing it.  I&#8217;ve put together an affiliate program where you get paid $3/month for each customer you refer to FeedmailPro.  You get paid this amount EVERY month for as long as they&#8217;re a customer so the recurring income potential from this is awesome (and totally passive, very appropriate for this blog).</p>

<p>All you have to do it create a an account at <a href="http://feedmailpro.com">http://feedmailpro.com</a> and click the affiliate tab on the right after you login.  There is no separate affiliate account to signup for - every account on FeedmailPro has the affiliate option.  Even if you aren&#8217;t going to use the newsletter functions you can still be an affiliate with the one account.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/08/fmp_affiliate.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/08/fmp_affiliate.png" alt="fmp_affiliate" /></a></p>

<p>After you type in your Paypal email address where you want to get paid, you can start posting your affiliate link.  The stats on the page will automatically update so you can see how things are doing in real time.  You can see I even provided a sample message that you can tweet out with one click (your affiliate link is already inserted) to make it super easy.  Blog posts would probably work great too since the target market is bloggers.</p>

<p>You can see how many people clicked your link, of those how many created an account, and of those how many became paying customers.  You get commission for paying customers and your Paypal payments will automatically go out on the 1st of the month!</p>

<p><strong>Moving Your Newsletter Over</strong></p>

<p>Not only can it make you money, but it can save you money too if you&#8217;re currently using Aweber.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already moved my feeds over and sent my last payment to Aweber.  Boy did it  feel awesome to cancel, I am no longer beholden to their evil tiered pricing structure!  Here&#8217;s how you can experience the same utter joy and save yourself a bunch of money:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create an account at <a href="http://FeedmailPro.com">FeedmailPro.com</a> and add your feeds (either the RSS feed or just type your blog&#8217;s URL and it will find it).</p></li>
<li><p>If you custom designed your own email template at Aweber and want keep it, just login to Aweber and go to Messages -> Blog Broadcast.  Then click your feed and scroll down to view the &#8220;Source&#8221;.  Highlight all the HTML and copy/paste it into FeedmailPro (edit your feed and choose the custom HTML template).  All the fields will work exactly the same so you don&#8217;t need to change a thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Send yourself a test email to see how it looks.  Nice!</p></li>
<li><p>To import your subscribers, login to Aweber and choose Subscriber -> Search.  Under View Segment choose &#8220;Active Subscribers&#8221;.  Then click the excel icon to save the file.  In FeedmailPro go to Subscribers -> Import and upload the file.</p></li>
<li><p>Add your mailing address on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab of FeedmailPro.  This is required for Can Spam compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, turn off auto-send in Aweber - you don&#8217;t want duplicates going out.  Go to Messages -> Blog Broadcast then select your feed and scroll down to uncheck &#8220;send automatically&#8221;.  Save it.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s it!  You just saved yourself $50 or $100 a month in many cases.</p>

<p>After a few days when you&#8217;re comfortable using FeedmailPro, cancel your Aweber account and treat yourself to a nice dinner with the money you just saved!</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I told you about a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/my-next-project/">new project</a> I was working on, and I wanted to give you a sneak peak at how it&#8217;s going!</p>

<p>WARNING: this is a beta launch, and the site is still being developed.  So I DON&#8217;T recommend you start using it for your main newsletter or move your list over yet.  This is just for testing purposes.  I also ask that you don&#8217;t post about it anywhere else yet.  I want to keep the beta launch small and manageable (besides, it will be much more profitable for you to post about it once I have the affiliate program set up!)  Lots of things will be changing going forward.</p>

<p><a href="http://feedmailpro.com"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/08/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>The URL to check it out is <a href="http://feedmailpro.com">http://feedmailpro.com</a></p>

<p>A couple points worth mentioning:</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes it has the same layout/design as <a href="http://buyersvote.com">BuyersVote.com</a>. I did this just because it was the simplest and fastest way to get the site up quickly, and I like how it looks.  The design comes from <a href="http://designdisease.com/portfolio/blogging-pro-theme/">this</a> open source wordpress theme by Design Disease.</li>
</ol>


<p>Just as a side note: I personally don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth spending much time on the design when launching a Web 2.0 company.  If you have an awful design, I suppose it could hurt, but as long as you have something that is good enough, and doesn&#8217;t get in the way of your main message, then it&#8217;s not that important.  Your time is better spent elsewhere in the early stages (like on the product).  When the thing takes off you can always go back and get a professional design done.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you read the comments from my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/my-next-project/">last post</a> you may have noticed that my friend Erica brought up some very good points about the difficulties in running this type of business (namely, communicating with ISP&#8217;s to keep your deliverability rates up).  She was absolutely right and I got in touch with her for some advice.  After talking for a bit, we figured there might be a way to outsource the delivery part of it since it was something I definitely did not want to deal with (it was not passive at all).  After some research I turned up <a href="http://www.isipp.com/email-accreditation/">this company (ISIPP or SuretyMail)</a> who do exactly that: email accreditation and deliverability.  It turns out this is actually how Aweber themselves do it (they are a customer) along with a bunch of other well known email service providers (Constant Contact, etc).  So I have to give a big thank you to Erica for helping me out on that one.</li>
</ol>


<p>Obviously hiring a company like that is not a panacea and I&#8217;m 100% sure there will still be some sort of unexpected problems to deal with down the road (as with every startup), but at least this was a step in the right direction.</p>

<ol>
<li>Finally, check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BYUIydVldg">2 minute video demo I put together</a>.  It shows a quick overview and how easy it will be to move your account over from Aweber.  There is no doubt about it, I&#8217;m looking to steal a TON of business from Aweber on this one.  They probably won&#8217;t be happy about that and I need to be careful and make sure to do everything by the books.  But at the same time, they&#8217;ve been getting away with robbery for so long now with a mediocre product that it&#8217;s about time they got some competition.  Consumers will ultimately be the winner here by getting a better product for less money, and that&#8217;s really the beauty of capitalism at work.</li>
</ol>


<p>The video works best in fullscreen.</p>

<p>I still need to add some more features like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>generating the signup code for people to use on their blogs</p></li>
<li><p>the billing system and affiliate program (will be copying lots of code from UniversityTutor here so it won&#8217;t take long)</p></li>
<li><p>a way to automate adding subscribers with an API</p></li>
<li><p>some more spam prevention stuff</p></li>
<li><p>a way for people to send one-time email blasts which aren&#8217;t from their RSS feed</p></li>
</ul>


<p>But most of the basic functionality is there.  At least enough to start getting feedback on it.</p>

<p>Please take a moment to check it out at <a href="http://feedmailpro.com">http://feedmailpro.com</a> and let me know what you think!</p>

<p><strong>Please send me your thoughts on what you like and don&#8217;t like about it in the comments below.  If you encounter any strange bugs feel free to report them in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/feedmailpro/topics">FeedmailPro Support Forum</a> I set up.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>WARNING: this post gets a little geeky talking about a tool for bloggers.  Some of you might not have an interest in it but I thought I&#8217;d post it regardless.</p>

<p>About a week ago I was sitting around with nothing super urgent to do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.universitytutor.com/">UniversityTutor.com</a> has been running on auto-pilot almost 100% with new tutors signing up every day.  I only need to answer about 1 or 2 emails per week on it, especially as the <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com/faq">FAQ</a> page has grown and becomes more complete.  Sure there are a few little things on my list to add for it (for example, about 1 in every 500 tutors who signs up managed to enter an address which doesn&#8217;t come up in Google maps correctly, and it breaks some stuff.)  But I couldn&#8217;t get excited about fixing it.  It just didn&#8217;t affect enough people.</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="http://buyersvote.com/">BuyersVote.com</a> is in a holding pattern as I wait for Google to index some stuff.  I&#8217;ve been using it quite a bit myself and finding it much easier/faster now to fit into my workflow if I want to add something quickly.  There are actually a bunch of things I&#8217;d like to eventually add there too (a demo video for the home page, make the vote-up and vote-down buttons more responsive, maybe a press release to get some PR for it).  People are actually able to <a href="http://buyersvote.uservoice.com">vote</a> on what features they&#8217;d like to see next, so I can prioritize them.  But nothing really struck me that day.</p>

<p>So I turned my attention to something that had been bothering me for a while: Aweber.  Aweber is an email newsletter service that lots of bloggers use to offer email subscriptions.  Aweber had been annoying me for a bit.  I use it on <a href="http://homeworkhelpblog.com/">HomeworkHelpBlog.com</a> (the blog for UniversityTutor) and every month it had been costing me more and more.  It was about to reach the point where I was paying $70/month for it, and this was just ridiculous.  That was more than my web hosting, credit card processing, etc combined.  For a simple email newsletter!</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/homeworkhelpblog1.png" alt="homeworkhelpblog" /></p>

<p>Worse still, the user interface to manage your Aweber is horrible and I could never get it to do what I wanted.  The whole site was clearly designed by some very technical people who had no concept of how people would actually use it (and then threw a pretty coat of paint over it).  For example, let&#8217;s say you were designing an HTML email and you saved some changes on Aweber.  You might want to see how those changes looked before it got sent out to your entire list of thousands of people right?  Well Aweber didn&#8217;t let you do this (for a blog broadcast).  You have to wait until your next blog post and just hope it looked right.  Or what if you wanted to send out your entire blog posts to people by email (and not just summaries which would piss them off by making them click through to your site).  Well, Aweber didn&#8217;t offer this and provided an embarrassing hack in their &#8220;help&#8221; pages which would require you to do extra work on every single future blog post you made.</p>

<p>There were other little things.  Aweber pulls the feed in a way that Adsense for feeds doesn&#8217;t show up.  They charge you for subscribers who have UNSUBSCRIBED from your feed.</p>

<p>Aweber also prides itself on how there are &#8220;real human&#8221; beings there to answer customer support calls and brags about this on its site.  This bugged me too - you do realize I don&#8217;t actually want to EVER call your tech support.  Do you think I enjoy waiting on hold, answering phone prompts, and speaking with people who have no authority to actually fix the problem?  Here is a tip for web businesses: If I ever have to actually pick up a phone to call you for tech support, you&#8217;ve already failed.  If I&#8217;m calling it&#8217;s because you messed up, and your site is broken.  Instead of paying for a huge phone center of support reps - why not just FIX your website.  Look at Gmail, millions of users and not a phone number in sight.</p>

<p>Anyway, so how were they getting away with charging this much for a crappy service?  The answer I think lies in their tiered business model, and the fact that it&#8217;s very difficult to move your email list.  You can start out with them at a very low price.  And once they have you locked in it keeps going up.  The kicker is that if you ever want to try a different service they make it very difficult for you because all the newsletter companies out there require you to send another &#8220;opt-in&#8221; email to all your subscribers if you move.  This annoying and confusing email basically ensures you will lose about half your subscribers if you ever move.  So they&#8217;ve got you, and they know it.</p>

<p>A while back I wrote an <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/07/03/rss-to-email-comparison-review-feedburner-feedblitz-zookoda-aweber/">article for ProBlogger</a> on this exact topic, and complained about the lack of options out there for bloggers.</p>

<p>So I was sitting there thinking about how I could probably code up my own newsletter service really quickly, and save myself $70/month.  And if I wrote it myself, I wouldn&#8217;t have to mess with this silly &#8220;extra opt-in&#8221; business.  Then I started thinking that if I wanted this for myself, maybe other people would want it too.  But then&#8230;wouldn&#8217;t it be a big hassle to open it up to the public, if people started trying to game the system etc and use it for spam or something like that.</p>

<p>So I let it marinate in my brain for a few days until I eventually came up with (what I think is) a great solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say some new user signs up and wants to import their list of 10,000 subscribers from Aweber.  Why not trust them (by default) and test out the list in a programmatic way which doesn&#8217;t require a manual, human review process (which would never be 100% effective by the way - people can fake credentials if they want).  Why not send the next email to say&#8230;10 of those subscribers on the list, and see how many (if any) come back as bounces, complaints, unsubscribes, etc.  If all is well, send the next email to 100, and the next to 1000, and eventually you could be quite confident that the list is valid and start sending to the whole thing.  If flags went up after you first few tests (in the form of lots of unsubscribes, complaints, or bounce) then the person is probably a spammer and you just close their account.  If would be worth it for them to send out 10 or even 100 emails, when they deal in millions of emails.  The whole process would take less than a week or two (however fast they sent out 4 blog posts) and the cool part is that none of the subscribers would actually have to &#8220;miss&#8221; an email.  The ones who got later emails would just have more posts in those emails until the &#8220;import&#8221; process was done.</p>

<p>If that worked&#8230;then the rest wouldn&#8217;t be too hard.  Make a user interface that actually, worked.  Let people test their emails, import their list from whatever crappy provider their using now.  Get rid f tired pricing and make the service a flat $10/month with the first 1000 subscribers free (the real cost to run this is almost nothing if you don&#8217;t have huge phone support centers and a broken site).  It would be a freemium business model that would save people a ton of money over Aweber.</p>

<p>Then if I built it, I&#8217;m pretty sure I could get Darren to let me do another post on ProBlogger (which has over 100,000 readers - all bloggers, many of whom use Aweber).  This would be an easy to launch the product to a ton of people.  I could also set up a nice affiliate program so every blogger who tried it would probably blog about it to others&#8230;and wow, this could turn into a nice little business.  Maybe a week or two of work to build it.</p>

<p>So anyway, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been working on the last week or so.  I should have a prototype out for you to look at later this week (you&#8217;ll hear about it first here if you want to be a beta tester).  Some of the technical issues involved with running a mail server and the Can Spam Act are quite technical, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s anything I can&#8217;t handle.  I&#8217;m already running my own mail server for UniversityTutor and it hasn&#8217;t been too bad.</p>

<p>I could probably do an entire other post on the technical aspects I&#8217;ve gotten into actually.  One cool part is that I&#8217;m modularizing the server which actually is going to do the mass mailing.  The reason why this is cool is that if a problem ever does happen and the mail server does get black listed due to a bug in the code or malicious users, etc, I can literally just spawn a new server with a new IP in 5 minutes and have a clean server.  I can also clone/spawn new mail servers on the fly to keep up with demand if this thing gets huge overnight.  In this sense they are like worker processes, totally separate from the main server with the database and serving up the homepage, etc.  Workers can get killed off without the whole machine coming down.</p>

<p>Suffice to say I think it&#8217;s gonna be awesome.  I&#8217;ll send you link to try it out later this week!</p>

<p>Hopefully it will be a nice addition to my &#8220;portfolio&#8221; of sites out there, running on auto-pilot.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Saw this great video about Facebook&#8217;s development team today.  Got me thinking&#8230;more companies need to think like this.  Focused, uninterrupted work is the greatest gift you have&#8230;but how often do we really do it?</p>

<p>Generally speaking, if you are answering your phone, opening snail mail, chatting, emailing, even talking with other people at all&#8230;you are NOT working.  Sorry to say it but you&#8217;re not.  Work is when you are alone, by yourself in your room, with all communication devices turned off.  20 minutes later you&#8217;ll actually be in the zone and then you&#8217;re really working.  That&#8217;s when you get real writing done.  That&#8217;s when you can strategize about the next moves for your company.  That&#8217;s when you can design great marketing.  That&#8217;s when you can design great art or great engineering.  That&#8217;s where breakthroughs happen.  That&#8217;s when you see connections between completely different ideas and how they could be better together.  That&#8217;s when you really produce instead of just reacting to things all day.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a fragile state that you can be broken out of easily too with any sort of interruption.  Doing this type of intense mental focus isn&#8217;t easy, and it&#8217;s quite rare to do it for 8 hours a day (it&#8217;s like sprinting for 8 hours a day - you&#8217;ll need a long recovery period).  But it&#8217;s totally reasonable to do this for maybe 3 or 4 hours a day, staggered with periods of rest.  Most people have huge mental routines to prepare themselves for these intense sessions, and we avoid them psychologically.  Ok&#8230;first get coffee, then browse headlines, ok finally settling in for some work&#8230;put on favorite soundtrack&#8230;..avoid a dozen other temptations&#8230;and GO.  And usually every 90 minutes or so you&#8217;ll have to break out of that state and take a mental breather for 20 minutes.  You need the breaks to recover mentally and physically to keep blood sugar up etc.  It&#8217;s a mental marathon.  But it&#8217;s also the only way to get real work done.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=238358730483&amp;ref=nf">Link to the video here.</a></p>

<p>Try to have more of these intense mental sessions every day on something you love and have the potential to one day be the best in the world at.  It could be practicing guitar, or it could be building the next great web company.  Stop talking about doing something and go do it today in an intense, focused session.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did a great interview with Gordie Rogers recently about BuyersVote.com.</p>

<p>I think it turned out really well, and you can read the <a href="http://lifestyledesign4u.com/2009/07/interview-brian-armstrong-talks-about-his-newly-launched-buyersvote-com/">full post here</a>.</p>

<p>It really helped me clarify my own ideas to write some of them down.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think the biggest challenge for BuyersVote moving forward will be reaching critical mass. There is a definite network effect where the more votes you have, the more people want to vote and the more valuable the site is. So the biggest challenge will be getting those early adopters who really believe in the idea and are willing to participate before it’s huge. I think the central idea of the site, which is that the content is 100% controlled by you and that the site will always be 100% free, will help contribute to this. There is also a huge “make the world a better place” potential to this project which I think is enticing. Scams and bad companies can be eliminated, people will get more value for their money, etc. It’s basically a free and more useful version of Consumer Reports and the Better Business Bureau. To me these are important ideals, and hopefully others will see the potential in it as well.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a month ago I wrote about how I was going to split test the prices on <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com">UniversityTutor.com</a>.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d share some results with you.  As you recall, I was split testing two price points.</p>

<p>The way it works is that tutors sign up on the site and get three free job requests.  After that they get an email asking them to upgrade and become a paying member.  I&#8217;ve recorded the number of emails sent out, and the number that actually subscribed.</p>

<p><strong>Test Group 1:</strong> $9.95/month or $79.95/year</p>

<p><strong>Test Group 2: </strong>$5/month or $45/year</p>

<p>Just a quick reminder: both price points had a monthly and yearly option.  I was NOT testing the monthly price vs. the yearly price.  I was testing a lower price (both monthly and yearly) vs. a higher price (both monthly and yearly).</p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-2.png" alt="Picture 2" /></p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t quite enough data yet to be super precise, but we can paint some broad strokes&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The conversion rate was about double for the lower price.  That means I could make the service affordable to twice as many people with no loss in revenue (one option).</p></li>
<li><p>Very few people chose the yearly option.  After thinking about this a bit I realized that most tutors are college students and will be moving during the summer.  They probably don&#8217;t plan on tutoring year round necessarily.  I&#8217;ve since added a line to the email saying &#8220;you can move or change cities and keep the same tutor account active&#8221;.  This may help, we&#8217;ll see.</p></li>
<li><p>Revenue was higher in Group 2 because one person chose the yearly option.  Without this, revenue would have been $60, and revenue per email $0.42 - just barely lower.  The only reason you might want to look at it like this is that with so few people choosing the yearly option, we don&#8217;t have statistically significant data there.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The 4% or 8% conversion rate might sound low, but from what I&#8217;ve seen of other major sites this is actually quite good.</p>

<p>Also, just a quick note on HOW I actually did this test.  I unfortunately had to program it by hand.  Basically I setup a piece of code which recorded whenever an interesting &#8220;event&#8221; took place, such as an email going out or someone subscribing and saved it to the database.  I wish there was an easier way to run tests like this.  The closest thing I&#8217;ve seen is Google Website Optimizer, but I&#8217;ve found it very difficult to use when running tests like this, and that&#8217;s why I coded it by hand.  Not an ideal solution for everyone I know, but I thought I should mention it.</p>

<p><strong>Next steps?</strong></p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t completely decided yet, but the option I&#8217;m leaning to here is to go with the lower price.  It seems worth it to get more tutors signed up at the lower price (who can evangelize the product and tell others about it - not to mention having more tutors available in searches on the site).</p>

<p>What do you think?  Also, if you have any other suggested split tests you&#8217;d like to see, let me know in the comments and I can try running them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished doing my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-and-create-a-personal-financial-statement-each-month-in-5-minutes/">financial statements</a> for last month, and was pretty happy when I noticed that it only cost a total of $1,018 USD for me to live and work in Buenos Aires last month!  That&#8217;s really cheap, certainly much cheaper than living in the U.S.</p>

<p>This proves the point I <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/oh-snap-im-moving-to-south-america/">wrote about a while back</a>, which is that it really isn&#8217;t that expensive to travel the world if you do it right.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>How can you afford to travel the world?</strong>
It’s not that expensive.  Most people think of world travel like a vacation – and that’s not the right way to think about it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vacations are expensive because you still have all your expenses back home (mortgage/rent, car payment, gym, cell phone, etc) to make in ADDITION to the new expenses you just rang up (plane ticket, hotels, etc). It’s basically like living in two cities at once.</p>

<p>But I’m not taking a VACATION to South America – I’m actually MOVING there. This means I will not be paying any living expenses in the U.S., I will be selling my car, and will be canceling or putting on hold all other expenses (phone, gym, etc).</p>

<p>I won’t be staying in hotels there or paying tourist prices. I will be renting an apartment (probably month to month). The plane ticket to get there isn’t cheap (about $1,000) but once there most travel around South America can be done on buses or trains (or even short plane trips city to city) very inexpensively.</p>

<p>So what did I actually spend my money on?  Here&#8217;s the breakdown&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-51.png" alt="Monthly Expenses Living In Buenos Aires June 2009" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>$450 - renting this <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/video-of-my-apartment-in-buenos-aires/">room</a></p></li>
<li><p>$88 - my health insurance from the U.S.</p></li>
<li><p>$480 - everything else (cash expenses) mostly food</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Normally I&#8217;d break down expenses further by looking at credit card statements, but people don&#8217;t really use credit cards much in Buenos Aires so I don&#8217;t have a good record of it.  I pay for everything with cash so it&#8217;s all lumped into that $480.  Probably most of it is food and drinks though.</p>

<p>For that amount you can live pretty nicely here&#8230;I think I ate out for dinner almost every night in June (might have cooked dinner at home once) and my room is in probably the nicest neighborhood in Buenos Aires.  But on the other hand, it&#8217;s not like I had a <a href="http://www.ba4uapartments.com.ar/en/recoleta.html">penthouse</a> with a private pool or did any lavish shopping or anything like that (although those are pretty reasonably priced too).</p>

<p>So anyway, if you have a business that let&#8217;s you be mobile while working, &#8220;moving&#8221; to Buenos Aires can be a great way to save some money and have an adventure in the process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following up from my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-make-buyersvote-com-easier-to-use-with-pictures/">post</a> a few weeks ago, I&#8217;ve made some big changes to <a href="http://buyersvote.com">BuyersVote.com</a> to simplify it and make it easier to use.</p>

<p>Now, instead of adding each page individually with a long list of fields to fill out, it&#8217;s possible to add an entire category with lots of pages in just two lines, right from the home page.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-9.png" alt="Picture 9.png" /></p>

<p>Much simpler, right? For example&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-8.png" alt="Picture 8.png" /></p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to have an account to do this (you&#8217;ll see a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">captcha</a> if you don&#8217;t have one).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what it creates: a page for the category (shown below) and a page for each individual item.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-10.png" alt="Picture 10.png" /></p>

<p>From here you can quickly vote items up or down.  The 1-10 rankings are now gone - only a simple +1 or -1 for each user is allowed - and the box simply shows the total number of votes that item has gotten. You can also add additional items if you&#8217;ve forgotten any (like Excel in the example below if you feel this is a valid option).</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-11.png" alt="Picture 11.png" /></p>

<p>Clicking an individual item brings you to it&#8217;s page, where you can write a more detailed review (instead of just voting up or down) and eventually see all reviews left by other users.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-12.png" alt="Picture 12.png" /></p>

<p>When you&#8217;re all done, it might look something like this.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-13.png" alt="Picture 13.png" /></p>

<p>Now the important part happens: OTHER users can come to site and make their own votes, write their own reviews, and add other items to the category that you may not have known about.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-17.png" alt="Picture 17" /></p>

<p>Eventually, you will have a complete and accurate ranking of all personal finance software on the market!  (Note: this is just a hypothetical example and those aren&#8217;t real reviews being shown.)</p>

<p>Compare this to the way it works now where you do a Google search for &#8220;personal finance software&#8221; and get nothing but subjective pages trying to sell you something.</p>

<p>Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that if you do want to create an account (it&#8217;s required for voting, to keep it fair) you can still login with just two clicks and you DON&#8217;T need to create a new account to use BuyersVote.com! You can use an account your already have (like Google, Yahoo, Facebook, etc). This uses the very cool <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openid">OpenID</a> technology.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-15.png" alt="Picture 15.png" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m still finding things I&#8217;d like to tweak as I use it myself, and it will continue to evolve, but I&#8217;d really like to get YOUR feedback on what you like and what you don&#8217;t.</p>

<p><strong>Please do me a favor and <a href="http://buyersvote.com">click here to try it out</a>!  Create a new category if you&#8217;ve got a second.   I&#8217;d love to get your feedback in the comments below, and see how to make it better!</strong></p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free,
Brian Armstrong</p>
