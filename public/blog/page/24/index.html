  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a year ago I walked into the local <a href="http://www.score.org/">SCORE</a> office in Houston and was very impressed.  I waited only a few minutes for my appointment (which I&#8217;d made on their website) and was soon sitting across from an elderly retired gentleman in full suit &amp; tie who was once the CEO of his own large successful company with over 100 employees (before he sold it and retired).  We talked for several hours, he listened to my good ideas and my bad, was respectful and asked lots of questions, and occasionally offered sage like advice.</p>

<p>After this we kept in touch by email, I can go back for more meetings whenever I wanted (he volunteered about one day per week) and it was all free.</p>

<p>SCORE is an outstanding and under utilized resource for would be entrepreneurs.  The volunteers are all former entrepreneurs themselves - which you know if you&#8217;ve been reading this blog for a while is very important to me.  <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/interview-with-a-self-made-millionaire-steve-davis/">You should only get advice from people who have actually accomplished what you&#8217;re trying to do</a>!</p>

<p>Whether you have an existing business, or have no idea where to start, SCORE is highly recommended.  If you are lucky enough to live in a city where they have an office, do yourself a favor and go make an appointment right now: <a href="http://www.score.org/">http://www.score.org</a></p>

<p><strong>Also worth reading:</strong> <a href="http://www.mavericksatwork.com/?p=108">Maverick&#8217;s At Work</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Old version: work hard (for a very long time), achieve success, earn freedom (to retire and do all the things you missed out on while you were working)</p></blockquote>

<p>New version: find work that affords you freedom = success</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People tell me their business ideas all the time.  They usually want to start a restaurant, or sell something they made, or give their advice as a consultant or coach.</p>

<p>But those businesses don&#8217;t scale.  The only way people get rich is by developing a product or service that can help a LOT of people, not just a few.</p>

<p>If each person that you help requires <strong>your personal time</strong> then there&#8217;s only so many you can help, and you probably won&#8217;t get rich doing it.  (Even if you don&#8217;t care about getting rich and just want to help people, helping individuals is still an inefficient use of your time, more on this later.)</p>

<p>Sure you can make quite a bit of money in the right job working hourly.  Doctors and lawyers get a high hourly wage.  But they still have to help each person individually which is why they can never be as rich as someone like Bill Gates who has a scaleable business.  His software gets written once, and then distributed to millions of people with very little additional effort for each person who is helped.  Bill Gates makes money from his software while he sleeps, whereas doctors and lawyers still have to keep putting in the hours to get paid.</p>

<p>Scaleable businesses require much more work up front, but once they are off and running they require little or no additional time per person.  That&#8217;s power because once your business system is in place, your time is still &#8220;preserved&#8221; for you to work on your next business idea and help even more people.</p>

<p>Compare each of the following.  Which one scales better?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Giving a speech to a group of people vs. making a recording of that speech to distribute</p></li>
<li><p>Flipping houses vs. building a real estate portfolio over time</p></li>
<li><p>Cooking for a bake sale vs. licensing your recipe</p></li>
<li><p>Your band playing at a local festival vs. selling songs on iTunes</p></li>
<li><p>Talking to customers over the phone vs. taking taking orders through your website</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting checks vs. accepting credit cards</p></li>
<li><p>One-on-one coaching sessions vs. selling a book</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping in touch with friends by email vs. writing to your blog</p></li>
<li><p>Being a freelance programmer for one client vs. selling subscriptions to your software to many clients</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Even if you don&#8217;t care about making money and just want to help people, I&#8217;d still argue that you need a system that scales.  You can do the same kind of comparison for non-profit work&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Volunteering your time at a homeless shelter vs. developing a city wide program to help thousands of homeless</p></li>
<li><p>Feeding a hungry family vs. improving education/changing legislation/etc</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It might give you a warm fuzzy feeling to help an individual, but in general I think you&#8217;re setting the bar too low when you do that and selling yourself short.  Spend your time on something that will really have an impact.</p>

<p><strong>Making a scaleable business is not easy (otherwise everyone would do it).</strong></p>

<p>While working hourly, you can see a paycheck in as little as a few days or weeks.  It&#8217;s dependable.  But while building a scaleable business, you can see zero return for months or years (or maybe never).  All the work is up front.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the old linear vs. exponential growth.  That&#8217;s why most people don&#8217;t get rich.  They don&#8217;t want to put the time in up front to see the big payoff down the road.</p>

<p>The next time you have a business idea, try to think about how it will scale and if it could ever really help a TON of people.  If not, is it really worth pursuing?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is not an interview that I did, but I really like it and have listened to it many times.  Ignore the part at the beginning if you don&#8217;t live in Houston, but listen all the way through.  It is absolutely outstanding.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite parts (paraphrased):</p>

<blockquote><p>Stop trying to reinvent the wheel.  Go out and find some one who is already getting the results you want, and model it.</p></blockquote>

<p>On finding a mentor:</p>

<blockquote><p>When looking for a mentor you have to ask yourself some tough questions about that person.  Do they have what I want out of life? (Wealth, time with family, etc).  Many people are unqualified to be your mentor, yet they give us advice.</p></blockquote>

<p>On retiring broke:</p>

<blockquote><p>9 out of 10 people in the United States from 1970 through 2000 retired at or below the poverty level.  You have to ask yourself why the vast majority of the nation would follow a path of building wealth that we know is ineffective.</p></blockquote>

<p>Who we should take advice from:</p>

<blockquote><p>Guess what the people who taught us how to build wealth (friends, family, professors) have never done?  Built wealth.  Do not talk to anyone about how to build wealth who hasn&#8217;t built their own wealth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Employee mindset vs. millionaire mindset:</p>

<blockquote><p>70% of millionaires in the United States are self-employed.  Most of the remaining 30% are unemployed and less than 1% of all millionaires are actors, musicians, athletes, or entertainment business related.</p></blockquote>

<p>You&#8217;ll never get rich helping just a few people each day:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ok I buy your concept that you have to help other people to make money.  But I&#8217;m already helping other people in my job.  Why am I not wealthy?  If you want to make a lot of money you have to help a lot of people.  To do that you must be leveraged with other people&#8217;s time, knowledge, and money.</p></blockquote>

<p>On beliefs:</p>

<blockquote><p>Does a belief have to be true to be debilitating?  No.</p></blockquote>

<p>Who gave us our beliefs about money:</p>

<blockquote><p>I would have to admit that in college I had a professor come to class, complain about his car note, house note, and financial condition, and then go on to teach 150 students college prep economics.  I became painfully aware that all of the people who&#8217;d given me my beliefs about money were unqualified to give them.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://how2livelife.blogspot.com/2008/03/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-being.html">The Inner Game Of Starting Your Own Business</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Entrepreneurship is very, very, very emotional. The emotional rollercoaster is such a substantial part of the entrepreneurship. I haven&#8217;t seen any entrepreneurship textbooks address this extremely important issue. If you’re doing anything you’re actually passionate about, this is a necessary requirement. You have really high highs, and really low lows.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.gurumastermind.com/media/The_Marketing_Voodoo_Report.pdf">Eben Pagen on How Small Changes In A Name Can Make All The Difference</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Answer this question, FAST:
Which of these two book titles sells more copies…</p></blockquote>

<p>Book #1: “A Thinking Person&#8217;s Step by Step Guide to Weight Loss &amp; Exercise Program”</p>

<p>Book #2: “Skinny Bitch”</p>

<p>A Thinking Person&#8217;s Step by Step Guide to Weight Loss &amp; Exercise Program
was written by two Ph.D.s and based on empirical research by guys with doctorate
degrees.</p>

<p>Skinny Bitch was written by an ex-model and an ex-modeling-agent (if that’s
how you say it).</p>

<p>Time’s up. Which one sells more?</p>

<p>Well, according to Amazon.com, A Thinking Person&#8217;s Step by Step Guide to
Weight Loss &amp; Exercise Program is their #437,317th best-selling book, whereas
Skinny Bitch comes in at #56.</p>

<p>My question for you is…</p>

<p>WHY?</p>

<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/03/why-bother-havi.html">Amazing People Don&#8217;t Have (Or Need) Resumes</a></p>

<blockquote><p>How about three extraordinary letters of recommendation from people the employer knows or respects?
Or a sophisticated project they can see or touch?
Or a reputation that precedes you?
Or a blog that is so compelling and insightful that they have no choice but to follow up?</p></blockquote>

<p>Some say, &#8220;well, that&#8217;s fine, but I don&#8217;t have those.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s my point. If you don&#8217;t have those, why do you think you are  remarkable, amazing or just plain spectacular?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey Folks,</p>

<p>Well the website has launched and you can go check it out here <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com/">UniversityTutor.com</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to show you a few more cool features that went into it, the results of some user testing, and what the next steps are to get my first sale.</p>

<p><strong>Making a UI to Input &#8220;Availability&#8221;</strong>
One of the things I knew from running an existing tutoring business is how hard it was to match people&#8217;s availability.  If I was going to automate the matching process I had to spend some serious time thinking about it.</p>

<p>There is both availability in terms of time and location.  Plus the added challenge of being compensated for driving time, which some tutors want.</p>

<p>The simplest solution is just to make a generic text field where people can write in anything they want for their availability.  This is not the best answer, because you will get an inconsistent look to the site and your customers are then forced to understand and compare all sorts of different things that sort of mean the same thing.  Its also unclear from this how detailed people should get.</p>

<p>Here is an example of generic inputs you can get from a text field which all mean pretty much the same thing:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am available Monday Wednesday and Friday after 3PM and Tuesday and Thursday After 5PM&#8221;
&#8220;WEEKDAYS AFTER 4&#8221;
&#8220;Mon/Wed/Fri afternoons Tues/Thurs after 5&#8221;
&#8220;MWF after three o&#8217;clock I am availabe and T/TH in the evening&#8221;</p>

<p>This just deals with time, not driving or compensation, plus you get the problem of spelling errors, etc.  It makes the site less usable.</p>

<p>Another option is to put in a full blown calendar system sort of like Outlook or Google Calendar which allows people to mark blocks of time.  This is a lot of code and testing, and more importantly its probably overkill for such simple scheduling needs.</p>

<p>In the end I found something that worked for me, and it wasn&#8217;t overly complicated.</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong>
For scheduling I made two drop down menus.  The first drop down shows days, and the second shows time.  The choices force the results to be consistent and gives them some flexibility in how detailed they want to get.  It also doesn&#8217;t let them get TOO detailed.  This is good and intentional.
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/time-availability1.gif" alt="Availability Time Scheduling" /></p>

<p><strong>Location</strong>
Again two drop downs.  One for distance, one for extra charge.  Notice I put the travel times in minutes, not miles.  This has to work in various cities and the travel time in New York for 1 mile is not the same as the travel time for 1 mile in Houston.  It also gives the user the flexibility to charge a flat fee for driving or at an hourly rate, while (again) keeping it simple enough by limiting their options.
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/locations-availability1.gif" alt="Locations Availability" /></p>

<p>The end result is a Google maps type page that looks like this:
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/google-maps-locations2.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/google-maps-locations2.png" alt="Google Maps Locations" /></a></p>

<p>Not perfect, but good enough for now and people seem to be getting it.</p>

<p><strong>User Testing</strong></p>

<p>Before launching, I sent the website link to some people and asked for feedback.  I asked them to put themselves in the mindset of my ideal customer (told them what that was) and told them to be brutally honest (otherwise people don&#8217;t want to hurt your feelings and will just say it looks good).  I also gave them the following questions:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>When were you unsure what to click on next?</li>
<li>What did you see that didn&#8217;t apply to you and was unimportant?</li>
<li>What questions did you have that weren&#8217;t answered?</li>
<li>What reservations would you have about signing up or what did you see that made you hesitate?</li>
<li>What spelling/grammar mistakes did you see?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I also sat down with some people and just watched them use the website, while keeping my mouth shut (this is important, you can&#8217;t help them at all!).  You&#8217;ll be amazed what you find when you do this.  Some things you thought would be obvious turn out not to be.</p>

<p>By the way, this is why Google&#8217;s web apps are so easy to use.  They do extensive user testing.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t get into the details too much, but just an example.  Remember the super cool feature I talked about at the end of the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">first preview</a>, &#8220;auto completion&#8221;?  Maybe it wasn&#8217;t so cool.</p>

<p>Turns out that it was confusing to people.  They didn&#8217;t understand to type a subject there like &#8220;algebra or chemistry&#8221; and people tried putting all sorts of things like city names only to get zero results.  Not ideal.  So one change I made there was to use a drop down of subjects.  Again, limiting the number of choices.  Seems to be a pattern there.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/subject-choices1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/subject-choices1-150x150.png" alt="Using A Drop Down To Limit Choices" /></a></p>

<p>There were a bunch of other changes made too as a result of user testing that I don&#8217;t have time to get into (pricing structure, clarifying how it works to first time visitors, etc).  Suffice to say that user testing is awesome and important and I&#8217;ll be doing a lot more of it.  There are some cool tools out there to watch what users on your website are doing in real time which I&#8217;ll be using in the future, and may write more about.</p>

<p><strong>Getting The First Sale, and Next Steps</strong></p>

<p>Once I have about 25 tutors signed up at a given school, I&#8217;ll be ready to start sending some traffic to the site and seeing how people react.  The best way to do this that I know of is Google Adwords.  It is probably the single most important advertising tool developed in the last 100 years, because it allows you to get targeted prospects looking at your product in about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Compare this to a magazine or TV ad for example which takes months to develop and get published and is very &#8220;un-targeted&#8221;.  What percent of people reading Parenting Magazine need a tutor at that particular moment?  Maybe 10% if you&#8217;re lucky.  But what percent of people who type &#8220;chemistry tutor&#8221; into a search engine need a tutor right now?  Close to 100%.</p>

<p>Anyway, I will probably start with just a few highly targeted keywords, like &#8220;chemistry tutor&#8221; or &#8220;algebra tutor&#8221; and get all the tracking code in place to see if those convert.  Then I&#8217;ll slowly ad more keywords in more geographic areas as I expand.</p>

<p>Just as a rough calculation, suppose that the average sale on the website goes for $15 (there are several different pricing points, but say this is the average value per customer), and each click that I drive to the website costs $0.50.  That would mean for every 30 people who visit the website, one of them would have to buy to break even.  30 clicks times 50 cents = $15, the price of one sale.</p>

<p>1 out of 30 turns out to be about a 3% conversion rate.  Is this doable?  Yes I think so, although it may not be easy.</p>

<p>Some other factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Google rewards good ads by charging you less per click.  So if I can get my click through rate up there, I could end up paying less than $0.50 per click.  I&#8217;ve been studying <a href="http://www.perrymarshall.com/google/">Perry Marshall&#8217;s stuff</a> for a while now to learn all sorts of things on writing good adwords ads.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the real value of a visitor $15?  Hard to say.  They could end up having a larger life time value if they become a repeat customer, tell some friends, etc.  Many companies are ok with breaking even on the first sale in terms of marketing dollars, for the long term benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>What percent of people who use the free trial will end up buying down the road?  Again, remains to be seen and could drastically alter the 3% conversion figure..</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
Anyway, I hope that gives you a good idea of how to think about launching a business quickly.  Its been almost exactly one month since I first started this project (originally I thought it would be closer to two weeks, but still one month isn&#8217;t bad to launch an entire business!).  I hope to have my first sale on the site in the next month.</p>

<p>This is the speed and low cost that is possible when you know how to have an idea, and go for it.  Whether it works or not remains to be seen, but I&#8217;m excited to say the least, and will keep you updated here.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t checked out the site yet, please do so now: <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com/">UniversityTutor.com</a></p>

<p>And as additional user testing, please tell me what you think about it in the comments below if you have any suggestions for improvement or if anything on the site is confusing.</p>

<p>If you need a tutor and live in one of those markets around Austin, Cambridge, or Manhattan, please sign up for a free account and try contacting some tutors.</p>

<p>Thanks!

<blockquote><p>The reason I love this story is that it&#8217;s as stark an illustration as I can find that &#8220;seeming impossible&#8221; is practically a requirement for a truly great innovation. If something seems possible, that&#8217;s probably because someone is already doing it. When something seems that it can&#8217;t possibly work, nobody tries it. Real innovation happens when someone tries anyway, overlooking an obvious flaw, and finds a way to make an idea work.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Caffeine is a staple in office break rooms across the country, pepping up adults who slog through their days feeling drowsy and tired.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps we all just need a little bit more sleep?</p>

<p>A new study released by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) indicates that adults are not getting enough rest each night.</p>

<p>Of those questioned, 70 percent said they had not gotten enough rest or sleep every day of the past month.</p>

<p>I talk about this extensively in Breaking Free, how when I quit my job to become self employed, one of the greatest benefits was an improvement in my health (and amount of sleep I got each night).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working like mad man lately on <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">this new business website</a>, and its coming along really nicely.</p>

<p>Something I&#8217;ve been thinking about a lot is &#8220;how can you build trust on a website?&#8221;</p>

<p>People have an inherent distrust of any service they see online, due to the number of the scams out there, and just shoddy companies.</p>

<p>Online is very different than the real world.  In the real world when we meet someone we can get a &#8220;gut feeling&#8221; about them (ever heard that 93% of communication is non-verbal?) based on their body language, tone, rate of speaking etc.  We make instant snap judgments whether we know it or not about whether we like and trust someone or something.</p>

<p>But in the online world, we are blind.  We have nothing to go on except some words on a page, and human beings weren&#8217;t built to trust based on such limited information.</p>

<p>So here are some ideas I came up with to help built trust with prospective customers on yours website:</p>

<p><strong>1. Show that other people trust you</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/customer_rating1.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/customer_rating1-150x150.gif" alt="Customer Rating" /></a>It&#8217;s human nature to look and see how other people are acting (and copy it) any time we aren&#8217;t sure how to act.  This is hard wired into us by nature.  You see everyone else in your gang of primitive humans running away from something scary in the woods, well you better start running too.  Those who didn&#8217;t, never lived long enough to become our ancestors.</p>

<p>So what does this mean online?  If you can prove that other people trust you, it will give you instant credibility.  Typically people do this with testimonials, but another great way is to let customers write reviews (Amazon is the king of this by the way).  In my case, I&#8217;m letting customers write reviews of the tutors they used.</p>

<p><strong>2. Piggy Back on Someone Else&#8217;s Good Name</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/rice-university1.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/rice-university1-150x150.gif" alt="Use a brand name" /></a>The tutors that I&#8217;m hiring are all students at top universities.  Those universities already have a great reputation, especially in their respective markets, so why not make that painfully obvious (in marketing materials) right up front: THE TUTOR YOU ARE GETTING IS FROM THIS GREAT SCHOOL.</p>

<p>If you are a total unknown just starting off, sometimes you can using others good names (the components that go in your products, the talent who is helping put the product together, someone well known in the field who you can get to endorse your product just by sending them a free copy and a self addressed stamped envelope with their endorsement pre-written for them!) to help launch your product.</p>

<p>One area to be careful of here: don&#8217;t infringe on anyones trademark.  Originally I was thinking about using a domain name like HarvardUniversityTutors.com.  But this would be going too far I think, and could legitimately cause confusion with customers thinking I was affiliated with the university.  I&#8217;m sure it would be just a matter of time before I heard from Harvard&#8217;s lawyers if I used that name!</p>

<p><strong>3. Give Something Away For Free</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/something-for-free1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/03/something-for-free1-150x150.png" alt="Give away something for free" /></a>Finally, no matter what you do some people will just never trust you.  So let them try it for free.  No not just a money back guarantee.  If they have to put in their credit card info you have already lost them.  REALLY FREE.</p>

<p>Even if some people cheat the system, and only use the free version (or register a new email address every time) its fine.  You have to be ok with that and trust that the majority of people out there are honest.  By giving something away for free you will reach a much wider audience.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d rather get 50% of a million people to pay (and still help out the other 50% for free) than to get 100% of 10,000 people to pay.  If the 50% that cheat and never pay will still tell others about your product and some of them will pay.</p>

<p>The 37 Signals folks agree that <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch12_Free_Samples.php">giving away something for free</a> is essential.  Check out their &#8221;<a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>&#8221; book (which is outstanding by the way).</p>

<p>Eben Pagan has talked about this extensively too and he actually suggests you give away your BEST stuff for free.  People wonder, &#8220;well if I give away my best stuff, what will people pay for?&#8221;.  The counterintuitive but very important point here is that it is your free stuff (and best stuff) which will win people over and convince them how valuable you or your service are.  Without it they would never even take the chance to look at your stuff at all.  Convincing them is whats hard.  Once they are convinced, they will gladly pay even for only a marginal benefit.</p>

<p>Just help as many people as possible and the rest will sort of take care of itself.  Being stingy up front and asking people to fork over their money before you&#8217;ve proven yourself worthy, is a sure fire way to turn a bunch of people off.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
Those are some thoughts on how to built trust through your website.  In the next (and final) preview I&#8217;ll show you a google maps implementation I put together and show you the results of some early user testing I did.</p>

<p>The next step will be to start testing it with LIVE real people.  I have to keep reminding myself to not make it perfect.  Just get it out there and adjust as you go!</p>

<p>Until next time,
Brian Armstrong</p>
