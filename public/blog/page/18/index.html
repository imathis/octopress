  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since Friday things have been a little crazy in Houston as we recover from the Hurricane.</p>

<p>Yet, even when I was without power and water, my business in other cities managed to hum along almost without incident.  That&#8217;s pretty cool, and illustrates the power in passive businesses.  You can continue to have money deposited into your bank account even when the entire city shuts down.</p>

<p>Side Note: I did however get an email from Google Adsense saying they shut my account down for &#8220;click fraud&#8221; on this site.  That&#8217;s why all the ads have disappeared.  I have no idea why they think there was click fraud, but I&#8217;ve filed an appeal.  We&#8217;ll see what happens.  I&#8217;m pretty surprised, since most of my experiences with Google have been great up until this.</p>

<p>But back to the hurricane, I like to try and see the positive in every situation, and in reality the Hurricane was not that bad.  I tried to think of it as a vacation (or actually somewhat like camping given the lack of AC and canned food).  I got lots of reading done, bonded with people, and basically partied every night for 4 days.  Don&#8217;t tell anyone, but I actually ran outside through the hurricane with a group of people in our underwear at about 4am, and then went to the hot tub (relax, there wasn&#8217;t any debris flying at that time or anything like that).  It was one of those peak life experiences that you don&#8217;t want to miss.</p>

<p>People always freak out in situations like this which always seemed like the wrong attitude to me.  As I&#8217;ve written about before, <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/why-youre-worse-than-you-think-at-estimating-risk/">people are really bad at estimating risk</a>.  The hurricane really wasn&#8217;t very dangerous at all.  You have to put things into perspective, and it only killed 6 people in all of Texas.  More people than that die every hour in traffic accidents in the U.S.  Same with heart disease.  Not to mention the thousands of people who die every day of starvation around the world.  Sure, the hurricane might have set some people back financially, but it was also a good reminder of what&#8217;s really important in life.  People need to stop worrying so much and start enjoying life.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some pictures I took during the last four days.  Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I though ya&#8217;ll might enjoy <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/3-ways-to-be-memorable-by-breaking-peoples-patterns.html#comment-322045">this article I wrote for LifeHack.org</a> about how to connect with people.</p>

<blockquote><p>Life is full of little situations that you encounter regularly.  Some people don’t see these for the opportunities that they are: a chance to stand out, be different, and be memorable.</p></blockquote>

<p>They’re a way to quickly built rapport with someone so they can think back later and say “Brian…hmm, yeah he was the guy who does [BLANK]” or “Barbara, oh yeah she is the gal who said [BLANK]“.  You stood out enough to be remembered.</p>

<p>By breaking out of your comfort zone and doing something a little different than everyone else you can connect with new people on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The article covers three common social situations that come up and how you can use them to your advantage:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What to do when people ask: &#8220;How&#8217;s it going?&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Handshakes</p></li>
<li><p>The two most common small talk questions: &#8220;What do you do?&#8221; and &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Check it out by <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/3-ways-to-be-memorable-by-breaking-peoples-patterns.html#comment-322045">clicking here</a>.  Maybe it can help you meet that next entrepreneur or mentor.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Hi Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I would like to get a marketing opinion of you. I have offered downloadable e-books in the past for other educational products I developed but I had a problem with people stealing the work - buying one e-book, then copying it for others. I even had problems with my printed works in that regard. I had several of my online articles mishandled as well and have since removed every one. It was a bit unsettling since my sellable works were mostly purchase locally and I often knew who was doing it - makes one wonder about people and ethics. What kind of copyright security would I get or should I even worry about it? People seem to steal no matter how many protections one tries to implement. Do you have that problem with your works?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Karen</p>

<p>Hi Karen,</p>

<p>Yes I had the same issue.  Within a few months there were free copies of my book circulating online. But honestly&#8230;it didn&#8217;t bother me one bit. I was just glad people were reading it/using it etc.</p>

<p>The way I look at it, distribution and getting your ideas out there is more important than making money from it. In fact, if you get good distribution the money thing will take care of itself. For every person who reads it free, at least they are exposed to my ideas&#8230;then maybe they will benefit from it, and tell other people about it or subscribe to my blog, and end up making me money some other way down the road.</p>

<p>You could get it to 100 people perfectly locked down, get $100 from each, and make $10,000. Or you could get it to a million people, have 90% of them steal it, only get $10 from the remaining people, and still make more that way (a million).</p>

<p>Hope that helps, and until next time, keep breaking free!

<time datetime="2008-09-03T16:03:17-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 3<span>rd</span>, 2008</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I went rock climbing with my friend James.</p>

<p>About half way up the last run I hit what looked like a dead end.  The next handhold above me was WAY out of reach.  The piece of rock I was holding onto with my hands was right around my waist&#8230;but I couldn&#8217;t reach anything above it, just a smooth rock face.</p>

<p>How was I going to go up?</p>

<p>It seemed like I&#8217;d have to put my left foot where my hands were (near my waist) and stand up on my left foot.  But with nothing for my hands to hold at that point, I&#8217;d surely fall backwards, right?</p>

<p>I was pretty sure it wasn&#8217;t going to work, but with encouragement from below I decided to give it a go.  I&#8217;d start to step up&#8230;and then stop.  Then I&#8217;d start again just a few inches, and quickly retreat back to my handhold.</p>

<p>It just felt terribly unnatural&#8230;i mean, imagine how it would feel if you tried climbing to the top of a high ladder with no hands.  Then take the last step with just one foot, where the rung of the ladder was about an inch wide with no hands.  Yeah&#8230;it felt sort of like that.  It just wasn&#8217;t going to work, I could FEEL myself starting to fall.</p>

<p>I belayed back down to the ground convinced that this one was beyond my abilities.  Then a strange thing happened: James went up the same route, got to the point where I was stuck, stepped up on his left foot with no hands while hugging the wall, and somehow didn&#8217;t fall backwards.  Damn!  That broke my theory.</p>

<p>Being the competitive person I am, I was none too happy about this.  I decided to try it again.  This time, the same feelings in my head were all saying &#8220;this is not working, you&#8217;re falling, you&#8217;re falling, NO YOU&#8217;RE REALLY FALLING NOW!&#8221; but I forced myself to ignore them, and kept inching up on that left leg.  Lo and behold, I DIDN&#8217;T fall and managed to reach the next handhold.</p>

<p>I was as surprised as anyone.  I&#8217;ve never done a complete 180 from &#8220;I am absolutely sure this is impossible&#8221; to &#8220;I am absolutely sure this IS possible&#8221; so quickly.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that most things worth doing in life play out like this the first time you try it&#8230;including starting a business.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#8217;s going to feel very unnatural the first time you try it</p></li>
<li><p>What at first seems impossible, later is not only possible but can become easy</p></li>
<li><p>Having more experienced people around you can be an amazing motivator</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I bet the first time you make a million dollars it&#8217;s the hardest.  It probably doesn&#8217;t even seem possible at first.  But then you see someone else do it right in front of your eyes and it changes everything.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some people have been asking me how much money this blog makes.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading it for a while then you know I like making <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-and-create-a-personal-financial-statement-each-month-in-5-minutes/">monthly financial statements</a>, so as you might have guessed I track the numbers.</p>

<p>Here they are for August 2008.</p>

<p><strong>Income:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>$215.00 - <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">Book Sales</a></p></li>
<li><p>$87.70 - <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a></p></li>
<li><p>$53.00 - <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/advertise/">Private Ad Sales</a></p></li>
<li><p>$50.14 - <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/tla">Text Link Ads</a></p></li>
<li><p>$10.22 - <a href="http://www.kontera.com">Kontera</a></p></li>
<li><p>$3.50 - <a href="http://www.cj.com">Commission Junction</a></p></li>
<li><p>$1.36 - <a href="http://chitika.com/mm_overview.php?refid=barmstrong">Chitika</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>TOTAL INCOME: $420.92</p>

<p><strong>Expenses:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>$10.00 - Hosting with <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/1and1">1and1</a> (this includes a number of sites, not just BreakingFree)</p></li>
<li><p>$45.00 - Book printing and shipping costs (paperback only)</p></li>
<li><p>$5.00 - <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/e-junkie">E-Junkie</a> for processing book payments</p></li>
</ul>


<p>TOTAL EXPENSES: $60.00</p>

<p><strong>NET INCOME: $360.92</strong></p>

<p>As you can see I&#8217;ve been trying a variety of ad programs.  Some of them are under performing, like Kontera, CJ, and Chitika.  I&#8217;m always ready and willing to replace these with something that might work a lot better.  In particular the 125x125 square ads on the right side of this blog make very little money at all.  I was trying a company called PerformancingAds.com last month which brokers 125x125 square ads like that, but they didn&#8217;t make a single dollar :(.  That space can probably be put to better use.</p>

<p>If anyone has other suggestion for what has made them money on their blog, please post below in the comments.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think blogging is a good way to get rich quick, but if you enjoy writing about a subject then by all means it doesn&#8217;t hurt to make some money on the side.</p>

<p>The real benefit of blogging (at least in my mind) is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Writing your thoughts and interacting with others on a particular topic forces you to learn it better and faster.</p></li>
<li><p>From a purely egotistical point of view, it just feels good to help other people, get emails from them, and have people listen to what you say.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s like a personal journal to help you record and organize your thoughts.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s a good way to keep in touch with people who you wouldn&#8217;t ordinarily have time to communicate with on a regular basis.  They can still know what&#8217;s going on in your life.</p></li>
<li><p>It builds distribution for your ideas (also known as a permission asset) so that the next time you launch a project there are people who know you and are willing to check it out.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If the non-monetary reasons make enough sense for you to blog, then I think you can wake up a few years later and have a nice fairly passive income.  It certainly doesn&#8217;t happen quick though, and I&#8217;ve still got a ways to go.  I&#8217;ll keep you posted as things progress and I find other ways to make money from blogging as a side income.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I stumbled across this excellent resource today.  It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a> and it&#8217;s a free tool to collect feedback from your users and let them make suggestions.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/09/uservoice1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/09/uservoice1-150x150.png" alt="UserVoice.com" /></a></p>

<p>The reason why this is so brilliant is that it&#8217;s something you know you should do with every project, but it&#8217;s low enough priority that you never get around to doing it.  Usually I end up doing it informally like by emailing some people, or waiting for a complaint to come in.  But there is phenomenal gains in making it as easy as possible for people.</p>

<p>Google used this technique successfully throughout the beta launch of Gmail, which won all sorts of awards for doing exactly what people wanted.  Dell used this technique successfully with their site <a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com/">DellIdeaStorm</a> to figure out that their users wanted to buy PC&#8217;s with linux on them.  They never would have known if they didn&#8217;t ask, and now Dell makes a bunch more money offering that product.</p>

<p>No business is perfect when you first launch it.  But luckily you don&#8217;t need to guess what people want.  If you&#8217;re good at ASKING your customers what they want they&#8217;ll tell you.  It&#8217;s no secret.</p>

<p>Now you have the same quality tools as Google and Dell to listen to your customers.  It&#8217;s a fully featured site that has built in voting, anyone can submit a new idea, and duplicates are caught.  And it&#8217;s free.</p>

<p>There are even two little widgets you can install on your site to help you collect data.  One of them you can see on the right side of this blog which I&#8217;m using to allow people to suggest new blog topics.</p>

<p><a href="http://startbreakingfree.uservoice.com/pages/general?referer_type=top3"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/09/suggets-a-post1.png" alt="Suggest A Post" /></a></p>

<p>To try it out, click the above image and suggest or vote on a post idea.  The second type of widget I&#8217;ve installed on my tutoring site to get feedback and suggestions from clients and tutors.</p>

<p>This is really an outstanding site that just made things a lot easier for the small business owner.  Nice work <a href="http://www.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought ya&#8217;ll might find this interesting.  As you might know, I&#8217;m a big fan of split-testing.  This is a good example of why.</p>

<p>Here are two different sign-up pages I tested for my <a href="http://www.austin-tutor.com">Austin tutoring website</a>.</p>

<p>This one got a <strong>30% conversion rate</strong> (meaning 30% of people who came to the page filled out the form at the bottom and signed up).</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/slone1.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/slone1-150x150.gif" alt="Sales Letter One" /></a></p>

<p>This next one does all the &#8220;right things&#8221; taught in traditional copywriting (strong headline, testimonials, longer=better, strong call to action, etc) and did only half as well: a <strong>14% conversion rate</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/sltow4.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/sltow4-150x150.gif" alt="Sales Letter Two" /></a><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/sltow21.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/sltow21-150x150.gif" alt="Sales Letter Two Part 2" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a professional copywriter, but when dealing with a reasonably educated audience I think any of these &#8220;sales letter&#8221; type pages that contain lots of hype can turn people off.  There are too many scams on the internet and sales letters set off people&#8217;s &#8220;BS&#8221; detectors.  Sometimes simpler is better.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>What a great surprise! Your book is an excellent source of knowledge, and your ideas are inspiring. Unfortunately, I am feeling the way you state in your book: tired, frustrated, sick of helping others make money!</p>

<p>Web has always been on my blood, and I have developed several websites in the past. Reading your book made me think about using that skills to create my own business.  My recent ideas are: city travel guides, with a catchy name and a high-quality content.  Other idea (much bigger) would be to create something alike the company where I am right now: a classifieds website. The UK/France/US/Germany markets are very strong on this subject, but my idea would be to create a specialized classified website.</p>

<p>Hoping on your answers, opinions and suggestions. Once more, congratulations on your success. I am on my way to finish your book and I clearly feel motivated by your words, your teaching and the quotations you choose from famous entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Rui (from Portugal, in London)</p>

<p>Hi Rui.</p>

<p>Thanks for the email and kind words!  I think you are off to the right start.  I like both your ideas of a travel guide and classified site, but for separate reasons.</p>

<p>The travel guide could be good as a blog, or similar business.  Just be aware here that you will have to create a lot of content for it over time, so that burden will be on you unless you can get guest authors.  Make sure it&#8217;s a topic you love.</p>

<p>Also, it&#8217;s fine to target it locally just don&#8217;t get too specific or there won&#8217;t be a wide enough audience to build a big business.  <a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/affiliates/index.php?af=817297&amp;u=http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/952/alborz-interview/">This guy</a> was able to target his car blog to Australia even though there were lots of other car sites and that differentiation worked for him, just as an example.  He talks about this more in the interview mp3.</p>

<p>The classified site could be better as a forum or community site like that.  It will take work to promote it up front, but the benefit is that the users will be generating most of the content after it gets going, not you, so it will be more passive down the road.</p>

<p>Both of these types of sites could produce good advertising revenue once they get going.  It won&#8217;t be easy but I bet you could start a few of them and put a year into it to really get it going and it would work.</p>

<p>You are certainly on the right track, and it is so easy to put these type of sites up today that it shouldn&#8217;t take too long.  Doesn&#8217;t hurt to try a few out and see what takes off.</p>

<p>One final idea:  if you are trying to find a good topic for a blog/forum/classified site like this, try going to a giant magazine rack at a bookstore and look at all the topics out there.  If there is a magazine about a topic (cars, business, celebrities, health, minorities, etc) then you can be sure it has enough of an audience to make a business out of.  This has been one of the best ways I&#8217;ve found&#8230;you can just browse the magazine and think &#8220;is there already a GOOD website out there that is addressing these readers?&#8221;  If not you can be the first to make it!</p>

<p>Thanks and good luck!
Brian</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last 6 months or so I&#8217;ve become a big <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-economics-better-than-an-mba-in-just-28-minutes/">Milton Friedman</a> fan.  Complex issues like inflation, money supply, economic growth, unemployment, government spending, deficits, etc always seemed like complex issues to me with many sides to the story.  You could read or ask 20 different people about issues like that and you&#8217;d get 20 different answers.</p>

<p>Somehow, Milton Friedman seems to make them easy to understand, and I feel almost embarrassed that I didn&#8217;t understand them better before.</p>

<p>He has now passed away, but I just finished watching part of his 1980 documentary called &#8220;Freedom To Choose&#8221; and it&#8217;s outstanding.  You can <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5538021588734490153&amp;ei=1Oi0SP_OOqG0qAPj1sijBQ&amp;q=milton+friedman+free+to+choose">watch one part of it here</a>, although I recommend you check out the whole thing.</p>

<p>I was shocked when reading Fortune Magazine recently (where Obama and McCain discuss the economy) to see a quote from McCain stating that his economic role model was Milton Friedman.  That certainly caught my eye.  Although I&#8217;m more liberal socially on some issues than McCain, this was a huge plus for me.  I don&#8217;t think Obama&#8217;s plan for the economy makes any sense at all (he wants to raise business taxes, taxes on wealthy, and increase government spending&#8230; basically the exact opposite of what would help the economy).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, has decided to <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/fixing_the_world/">fund a study from the top 500 economists</a> (at great personal expense) to see where they fall on the presidential election coming up.  I feel pretty confident they will come down economically on the side of McCain (it&#8217;s just such a shame he hasn&#8217;t come around on some other issues, I&#8217;m not totally sold on him :).</p>

<p>Apparently, even <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2765840490646652904&amp;ei=1Oi0SP_OOqG0qAPj1sijBQ&amp;q=milton+friedman+free+to+choose&amp;vt=lf">Arnold Schwarzenegger is a Milton Friedman fanboy</a>!   (Which actually really helps explain his politics.)</p>
