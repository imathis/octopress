  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/09/superaffiliate_3601.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/09/superaffiliate_3601-150x150.jpg" alt="Example Information Product eBook Passive Income" /></a>This is part 2 of my series on <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/6-ways-to-generate-passive-income-that-sometimes-work-part-1-blogging/">generating passive income</a>.</p>

<p>eBook&#8217;s and info products are a very popular passive income generator right now, and I have to say that yes they can really work.</p>

<p>To read more, I would recommend <a href="http://www.income.com/blog/">John Reese&#8217;s products</a> (his Reese Reports in particular), <a href="http://www.surefiremarketing.com/">Yanik Silver&#8217;s</a>, and the <a href="http://www.warriorforum.com/forum/">Warrior forum</a> where you can get a ton of free advice.</p>

<p>To me eBooks and information products are synonymous with the &#8220;internet marketing&#8221; community.  Basically what these guys have figured out is that marketing is often more important than the product itself.  If you love marketing, this could be a big area for you to explore.</p>

<p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few ways people create information products:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Write an eBook yourself.  This is the least intimidating and how many people start, but can also be the most time consuming.</p></li>
<li><p>Hire someone else to do the research and write the book (outsourcing).</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare a speech and record the audio on your home computer as an audio book.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a video presentation using a screen capture program like <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp">Camtasia</a> or by recording short videos with a digital camera or web cam.  These can be edited together and made into DVD&#8217;s for about $2/each.</p></li>
<li><p>Organize a conference where you will present.  Record the video and produce a DVD.</p></li>
<li><p>Organize a conference where you invite other speakers who know more than you!  Record the video and produce a DVD.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see, you can produce an info product on a topic where you&#8217;re the expert, or be the organizer who brings in other experts.  You can compensate the guest speakers/writers monetarily, or offer them some form of paid promotion in the product such as mentioning their website.</p>

<p>Information products and seminars can command a very high price and a profit margin that would be considered absurd in any other business.  A DVD which costs you $2 to make could be sold for $500.</p>

<p>Information, especially information that can earn you money or improve your life in some way, is one of the most valuable products you can sell.  For example, think about how much importance some people would put on getting out of debt, making it through a divorce, becoming financially independent, or finding love.  If that is the primary problem in their life at the moment, then they would be willing to give almost anything for your help.  These educational or &#8220;self-improvement&#8221; type products are often easier to sell than say fiction or art which is subjective.</p>

<p>The advantage of the info product is that unlike a physical product, you carry no inventory.  And it is truly passive because (if setup correctly) you do zero additional work for each item sold.  It can often take a lot of effort to produce up front, but it can continue to pay you each week for years after that.</p>

<p><strong>Is this really feasible?</strong></p>

<p>Remember that the way I evaluate any claim behind a method of building wealth or generating passive income is this: how many people can I find who have used this method to accomplish what Iâ€™m trying to do?</p>

<p>While internet marketing and creating/selling info products has certainly created more than a handful of millionaires (far more then blogging for example), it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to call it easy.  I have never seen a hard study on it, but my impression is that of say 100 people who try it, 80% never really come out with a product of any kind.  Of the remaining 20%, probably 1% of those actually make enough money to quit their regular jobs.</p>

<p>By the way, if anyone knows of a real study on this or has information about how many internet marketing or information product millionaires there are, please post it!</p>

<p>I have a few other concerns with this approach as well.  Many of the tactics used seem to be questionable ethically, and are designed to take advantage of unsophisticated buyers.  Long over-hyped sales letters, false deadlines, and &#8220;last minute offers&#8221;, etc&#8230;.you&#8217;ve seen them all.  While I&#8217;m sure some of these work in the short term&#8230;.the only really way to make money is to create something of value which helps other people.  Some people creating info products understand this and create great stuff, but I dare say that the majority do not.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Creating info products could be perfect for you if you have a passion for a particular field (either you are an expert or know some) and enjoy studying the art of marketing.  It can be quite a challenge (and take a bit of a budget) to get the word out once you&#8217;ve created your masterpiece.  The majority who attempt it fail, and the field is constantly evolving and changing, but those who create a winner can end up really striking it big!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Hey Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I absolutely love your real estate articles. I have studied Rich Poor Dad&#8217;s stuff as well as many other books and REI programs.</p>

<p>Can you elaborate on how you are finding deals?</p>

<p>Thanks, K.T.</p>

<p>Hey K.T.,</p>

<p>I am finding deals two ways.</p>

<p>First, I am finding them on basic old <a href="http://www.har.com">har.com</a> (Houston&#8217;s MLS website, your city probably has something similar).  Some people assume there is a magical list of deals somewhere that isn&#8217;t accessible to the general public.  But there are great deals showing up regularly on the biggest public website.  They don&#8217;t last long, so you&#8217;ve go to know what to look for and move quickly.  I&#8217;ve put together a little video that shows the process I actually go through here:</p>

<p>[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8AdQ-MGL7w[/youtube]</p>

<p>Most of these techniques I&#8217;ve learned from a group of <a href="http://www.luinc.com">real estate investors</a> here in Houston.  Most major cities has an MLS website like <a href="http://www.har.com">har.com</a> in Houston were 95% of all residential real estate listings end up.  You can find yours most likely by typing &#8220;mls real estate [your city name]&#8221; into Google or asking others in the real estate industry.</p>

<p>I select a maximum price and a minimum square footage so I can target a price per square foot below about $45 to look for foreclosures.  Houses with a low price per square foot are typically in poor shape and are attractive to investors.</p>

<p>Then I&#8217;m doing &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparables">comparative market analysis</a>&#8221; (aka finding comps) on the houses to see what they are worth.  I use a tool called <a href="http://www.lifestylesquest.com">Quest</a> to do this (only works in Houston), but it can be done the long way also by pulling up the comps yourself on the MLS website.  If you need to pay to get access to a site like this (as I do) it&#8217;s probably worth it.</p>

<p>The goal (at least for me) is to find a house with a large spread between the asking price and what I think it&#8217;s worth after all repairs.</p>

<p>The second way I&#8217;m finding deals is through listing agents.  Basically I contacted a bunch of real estate agents, and filtered through the majority of them who only patrol the MLS website.  I searched for the minority who actually go out and get their own listings.  If you can establish credibility as an investor with a couple of these agents, they will bring you the deals!</p>

<p>You can find a list of agents in your zip code using the MLS website and just start calling the entire list.  Or if you find a good deal using the first method I described, you can stay in touch with that agent to see what other listings they get.</p>

<p>It can be tough to establish credibility with one of these agents because they get called by investors all the time who do nothing but waste their time.  Just be honest and tell them you don&#8217;t really know what you&#8217;re doing.  Don&#8217;t make big promises.  They are looking for someone who:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Knows how to analyze a deal and can make a decision right away</p></li>
<li><p>Doesn&#8217;t need to have their hand held and see 10 properties before buying one (often you can make an offer sight unseen just by analyzing the numbers)</p></li>
<li><p>Won&#8217;t try to lowball an already great deal (another investor will offer the asking price and you&#8217;ll never get it)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>You might have to call 20 agents to find one good one that will bring you deals like that (forclosures, short sales, etc).</p>

<p>Hope that helps and best of luck!</p>

<p>This is a great little tool developed by internet marketing guru John Reese who I&#8217;ve talked about before.  When I first read about it I thought it sounded pretty simple and ineffective, but it&#8217;s actually more powerful than I originally thought.</p>

<p>What it does it post related articles from other blogs around the internet on to your site, and likewise your articles start appearing on other blogs who use the widget.  But the beauty of it is that it contains a &#8220;referral system&#8221; which will really help it go viral.  Essentially, whenever someone clicks the widget on your site to add their own blog to the system, you earn a referral credit.  This actually goes 10 levels deep&#8230;meaning that the people you refer count toward yours, etc.  And the more referral credits you have the more likely your articles are to appear.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can watch a great little video about how it works and see it action by going here: <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/blogrush/">http://www.startbreakingfree.com/blogrush/</a>.</p>

<p>It takes a few minutes to install on your blog, so get in as early as you can.</p>

<p>The program is called BlogRush&#8230;and I think it will really shake things up in the blogging world.  Check it out now: <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/blogrush/">http://www.startbreakingfree.com/blogrush/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Brian, from a personal viewpoint I would love to see more on turning an idea for generating passive income into reality. I have dabbled with a few small things and had no success.
-David</p></blockquote>

<p>David,</p>

<p>I sympathize with your comment, and I believe many people have the same frustration.  Unfortunately there are a ton of people out there marketing the IDEA of financial freedom, without being able to deliver on the results.</p>

<p><strong>The way I evaluate any claim behind a method of building wealth or generating passive income is this: how many people can I find who have used this method to accomplish what I&#8217;m trying to do?</strong></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some common areas that promise the dream of passive income, and I can give you some thoughts on each.  Most if not all of these I have dabbled in myself just as you have, with mixed results.</p>

<p>First a quick note: to &#8221;<a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">break free</a>&#8221; you don&#8217;t necessarily need to generate passive income.  Breaking Free is first about finding work that you really enjoy (which for many people means having the freedom of owning your own business).  However, achieving what I call &#8220;financial freedom&#8221; (your passive income exceeds your expenses and you no longer need to work unless you want to) is another step beyond that which is more challenging and often more rewarding.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/09/770984_screenshot1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/09/770984_screenshot1-150x150.jpg" alt="Blogging To Generate Passive Income" /></a><strong>Blogging</strong></p>

<p>I like the idea of blogging, I&#8217;m a blogger myself, and I think it is doing brilliant things for social media around the world.  But let&#8217;s not mince words: blogging does not generate passive income.</p>

<p>Blogging is work.  Granted it&#8217;s very enjoyable to some people and doesn&#8217;t feel like work, but it certainly can take up a significant amount of your time.</p>

<p>People love to cite <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/">Steve Pavlina</a> as a case study in successful blogging, primarily because he earns over $1000/day.  That is a lot of money, but Steve still &#8220;works&#8221; on the site making regular posts and has stated that &#8220;I happen to agree with those who say that 99% of people who try to generate serious income from their blogs will fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>The numbers tend to agree with him, and don&#8217;t look good by my evaluation standard I mentioned at the beginning.  There aren&#8217;t very many bloggers earning even six figures (perhaps <a href="http://paulamooney.blogspot.com/2007/05/paulas-list-of-blogger-salariesare-you.html">fewer than 20</a> in the world) and you could probably count the number of blogging millionaires on one hand.  Moreover, the bloggers who are most successful seem to spend a huge amount of time (which by definition is not passive) reading, posting, and marketing just as I did <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">when I first marketed this website</a>.</p>

<p>There are exceptions.  <a href="http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/">Yaro Starak</a> is one person in particular who I&#8217;ve seen try to making blogging more passive with a site he purchased called <a href="http://www.smallbusinessbranding.com/">SmallBusinessBranding.com</a>.  All of the posts are by guest authors, meaning he doesn&#8217;t write them himself.  The site is growing and I don&#8217;t have any idea how much of his time it takes, or how much money it makes him (probably $500/month if I had to guess) but it&#8217;s an interesting experiment in making blogging more passive.</p>

<p>As of yet I remain unconvinced on blogging as a passive income tool.  Should you start a blog though?  Absolutely, I think <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/06/just-one-post.html">everyone</a> should because it has a number of <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/building-yourself-as-a-brand/">benefits</a>.  Just don&#8217;t plan on having it pay your bills without putting some serious work into it on an ongoing basis!</p>

<p><strong>Stay tuned for part 2, 3, 4, and 5 as I explore other methods of generating passive income (eBooks &amp; Info Products, Virtual Real Estate, MLM &amp; Network Marketing, Options, and Physical Real Estate).</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/09/brainstorm-ideas1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/09/brainstorm-ideas1-150x150.jpg" alt="Brain Storm Great Domain Names For Your Business" /></a>I just had dinner with a friend of mine, we&#8217;ll call him G.  He was stressing about finding a domain name for the IT company he started to &#8221;<a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">break free</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>If you want a great domain (not just a good one) and you&#8217;ve got $1000, buy one at <a href="http://www.sedo.com">sedo.com</a>.  It&#8217;s far easier than struggling to find one that hasn&#8217;t been taken yet.</p>

<p>But assuming you want to find one that is undiscovered and only pay $5.99 to register it&#8230;here is how you should proceed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set a deadline for yourself (or your team) when you will have the domain decided, NO MATTER WHAT.  Deciding on any domain, even if it&#8217;s not the absolute best in the world, is far better than <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">delaying the decision and wasting weeks of time</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid the temptation to start typing in random domains off the top of your head.  This is unproductive and will leave you quickly discouraged.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead do an effective brainstorm - not of domains, but of individual words that describe your customers, ideals, products, etc</p></li>
<li><p>Do the brainstorm on paper or a white board.  Don&#8217;t ask me why but physically writing helps you be more creative.</p></li>
<li><p>Brainstorm in a group of 2-5 people if possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Try not to judge or evaluate any idea during the brainstorm.  This will be tough not to laugh at some ideas or immediately discount them, but try not to!  It will stifle the creative process.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have a word written, branch off of it with other words that come to mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Try combining the words into potential domains.  Write new words as they come to mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Force yourself to create at least 20 combinations.  Check the availability of these at a site like <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the most exciting ones to your &#8220;top list&#8221; for later review</p></li>
<li><p>Go to <a href="http://www.bustaname.com">Bust a Name</a> and put in some of your words from the brainstorm.  Add synonyms where necessary.  Add the best ones to your &#8220;top list&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>Visit <a href="http://www.makewords.com/">MakeWords.com</a> and come up with 10 more combinations. Take your most important word and try adding different words to the beginning or end with MakeWords.com.  Add a few more to your &#8220;top list&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Do some <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">keyword research</a> and try to determine what your customers would type into Google when looking for you.  Use those keywords as your domain.  Important Side Note: You will most likely get on the first page of Google for that keyword within 30 days just for having that domain!  Add a few more to your &#8220;top list&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Most likely your top choice will be taken.  Try adding one of these words to the beginning or end of your perfect domain: pro, [your first/last name], [your city], e, i, my, online, home, web, net, live, source, zone, hub, page(s), the.</p></li>
<li><p>You guessed it&#8230;add a few more to your &#8220;top list&#8221;</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now you have your &#8220;top list&#8221; with all your best options.  Eliminate any that are clearly not going to win to shrink the list.  Shrink the list further by the following criteria.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How easy is the domain to spell?  Does it contain a word people frequently misspell or a word that sounds like another word (higher vs. hire)?</p></li>
<li><p>How well does the domain suggest what your company does (www.ibuildwebsites.com vs. www.joespage.com)?  What word association takes place when people hear your domain?</p></li>
<li><p>How memorable is the domain?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the domain improve your search engine rankings by using your keyword in the domain?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Once the list is narrowed, send a mini survey to your friends and ask them to pick their favorite.  Tally the results.  The ultimate decision is yours&#8230;just make sure you MAKE IT before the deadline.</p>

<p>Realize that you will never be sure about your decision at the time you have to make it.  That&#8217;s ok, make it anyway and relish in the fact that you accomplished something today.  As self-employed people who have &#8220;broken free&#8221; we must <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">become comfortable with indecision</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/42-166391101.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/42-166391101-150x150.jpg" alt="Make Tons Of Friends" /></a>One of the best parts about quitting your job to work for yourself is that you suddenly find time to do all the wonderful things you always wanted to do.</p>

<p>Sure, I was able to do some of these while working 10 hours per day, but I was frequently too tired or ill-prepared to get the full benefit until I started working for myself.</p>

<p>And when you build an active and interesting life by doing these activities on a regular basis, you can&#8217;t help but make a lot of friends along the way.</p>

<p>You see, the group activity is an excuse to see the same people on a regular basis - and really, if you hang out with someone more than a few times in the span of a month due to a shared interest, then by definition you are friends.</p>

<p>Some of those people you will naturally start to see more often, by meeting outside of the original activity (grabbing a drink, at a party you host, etc).</p>

<p>I think everyone should pick at least one item from the active category and one from the mental category.  Or if you want to really kick it off, do at least half a dozen each week.  I&#8217;ve listed some below, each of which I&#8217;ve done at some point in time.  I typically try each one for 6 months to a year and then try another to keep things fresh and interesting.  Some that I really love, I&#8217;ve been doing for longer, but you&#8217;ll never find out that you love it until you try.</p>

<p>Pick something that makes you a little bit nervous and realize that it&#8217;s ok if you aren&#8217;t very skilled yet.  You might feel like an idiot for the first few months when getting started in any new skill, but that&#8217;s ok ;)  Often it&#8217;s easier to find someone who has already gotten started in one of these sports, and ask to join them for the first time.  Don&#8217;t worry about holding them back, they will feel great finally knowing more than someone else and getting to be your teacher!</p>

<p><strong>Active Items (Exercise)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Learn self defense (I recommend Brazilian jujitsu and Thai kickboxing)</p></li>
<li><p>Take a break dancing class</p></li>
<li><p>Take a spinning class at the gym</p></li>
<li><p>Do a group session with a personal trainer and REALLY feel sore</p></li>
<li><p>Run around a local park or popular jogging spot (to meet more people, bring a dog)</p></li>
<li><p>Play one of my favorite sports of all time: beach volleyball (even if you don&#8217;t live near a beach, you can still find sand courts everywhere)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite someone of a similar skill level to play tennis each week, grow the group as you see fit</p></li>
<li><p>Try yogo or pilates</p></li>
<li><p>Go to an indoor rock wall, and try rock climbing!  (surprisingly, it has very little to do with strength, and is much closer to playing chess than lifting weights)</p></li>
<li><p>Go surfing</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Mental Items</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Take an improv comedy class at a place like <a href="http://www.comedysportz.com/">Comedy Sportz</a> which is in most major cities in the U.S.</p></li>
<li><p>Join <a href="http://mindpetals.com/blog/2007/07/five-reasons-all-entrepreneurs-should-join-toastmasters/">Toastmasters</a></p></li>
<li><p>Do some community theater</p></li>
<li><p>Join a local band, try <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMg34DXvfB4&amp;mode=related&amp;search=">composing some music on your computer</a>, or learn to DJ.</p></li>
<li><p>Join at least 3 <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com groups</a></p></li>
<li><p>Play <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-a-board-game-like-monopoly-can-teach-you-financial-freedom/">board games</a> with a group on a regular basis</p></li>
<li><p>Join a wine tasting club</p></li>
<li><p>Join at least one networking group such as <a href="http://www.bni.com/">BNI</a></p></li>
<li><p>Join at least one alumni organization from your school</p></li>
<li><p>Take some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Learning_Annex">Learning Annex</a> classes</p></li>
<li><p>Try doing a 5-minute standup comedy routine at open mic night at a local comedy club</p></li>
<li><p>Learn at least one form of Latin dance such as salsa or tango.</p></li>
<li><p>Visit a gun range, and get your concealed handgun license!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Everybody has that list of things in the back of their mind that they always thought sounded cool, but have never gotten around to doing.  Whether that is joining a book club or building custom race cars, you need to start doing it.</p>

<p>One final benefit: once you have an interesting life, you now can now invite every new person you meet to join.  Inviting a new contact to try rock climbing is much more memorable and exciting than inviting them to &#8220;do lunch&#8221; or &#8220;keep in touch&#8221; (they won&#8217;t).</p>

<p><strong>These are just examples, and there are PLENTY more.  What two items are you going to sign up for today?</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/mmlogo1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/mmlogo1-150x99.png" alt="Love Systems" /></a>I always like to hear about innovative business models, and todays interview is with the CEO of a company that teaches men and women how to get more dates and attract the opposite sex!</p>

<p>Nick is President and CEO of <a href="http://www.lovesystems.com/">Love Systems</a> Corporation and is the author of Magic Bullets, the &#8220;bible&#8221; of dating science and social dynamics. He loves adventure and a challenge. After college, he traveled the world for several years, managing international businesses in Europe, the Middle East, and South Africa. He started by gambling at backgammon for food and travel money across Turkey and finished by helping raise financing in Slovakia for Europe&#8217;s most promising low-cost airline http://www.skyeurope.com/. He has an MBA from Wharton and an Honors Degree in History from McGill University in Montreal. He has also consulted to several Fortune 500 companies around the world on business strategy.</p>

<p><strong>1. Did you always know that you wanted to start companies and work for yourself, or was there a specific moment that made you realize it? How did you get started?</strong></p>

<p>I was always attracted to the idea of being an entrepreneur, but always had a good excuse not to take the plunge.  Usually this was because of other great job opportunities.  I had a taste of the entrepreneurial bug running a clothing franchise when I was doing my MBA, and then did a stint with an entrepreneurial company in Europe (a new low-cost airline), and that whetted my appetite.  About a year or so out of business school, I realized that I was in the wrong job, and in the midst of looking for something new, the little voice in my head told me that it was time to take the plunge.  Ironically, this came right as I&#8217;d finally landed my &#8220;dream job&#8221; with a company I&#8217;d been dying to work with for years.  But I figured that the company wasn&#8217;t going to disappear in a year and everyone would still remember me, so I gave myself a 12-month horizon to test my entrepreneurial dreams and see what happened.</p>

<p><strong>2. What was the most important thing you learned in your time abroad?</strong></p>

<p>There are so many different ways I could answer that question, but most of them would seem like platitudes or self-indulgence when reduced to a paragraph of text.  In terms of &#8220;news I can use&#8221;, probably the most important business learning I&#8217;ve benefited from is the concept of business timing.  In the U.S. business culture, things work according to deadlines, agendas, and project plans.  If you need someone to sign off on a project by Thursday, you damn well better meet with them before then and you&#8217;d better get them to sign off.  In some other cultures, especially the Middle East where I worked for a while, people are much more sensitive to the emotional temperature of a room before pushing their agenda.  If you sense that the person you need something from is stressed, or for whatever reason not in the mood to engage your issue, you put it off.  It can be frustrating in that culture because it appears that some things take forever to get done and it&#8217;s not always obvious to an outsider why this is; however, coming to the United States I also get surprised when someone is trying to get me to do something when it&#8217;s obvious that I&#8217;m not predisposed at that moment to engage their issue.  To generalize, US business culture is based on time, whereas Arab business culture is based on timing.  The ability to combine both approaches is important.</p>

<p><strong>3. Did you have any mentors or role models that pushed you to see self-employment as a good option?  Bad option?  How can aspiring entrepreneurs meet good mentors?</strong></p>

<p>For sure.  When I was at SkyEurope, a startup airline in Central Europe, I learned a lot from the energy and excitement and spirit of the two co-founders there.  They couldn&#8217;t understand why someone of my age, skills, and background WOULDN&#8217;T be an entrepreneur.  It&#8217;s easy to talk yourself out of taking risks, but it&#8217;s a lot harder to explain this to someone else.  You sometimes realize how silly your arguments are when you have to verbalize and justify them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I had any great entrepreneurial mentors.  I never really sought them out, and this is something I&#8217;ve been trying to fix the last few months.  I&#8217;ve made a ton of mistakes, like anyone, and many of these could have been avoided with the type of experience and perspective that a mentor could provide.  And I can&#8217;t even begin to estimate the value of the lost opportunities that quality mentors could have helped me see. Anyone who wants to be an entrepreneur would be well-served to connect with successful people who have come before them.  And make sure to be respectful of their time and offer them value in return.  I&#8217;m in the process of setting up an advisory board, and there will definitely be compensation involved (that&#8217;s not to say that compensation is the only form of value that can be returned).</p>

<p><strong>4. Based on friends or clients you&#8217;ve worked with, how can being in the wrong job or being unhappy in your job affect other areas of your life?</strong></p>

<p>Most people spend about half of their waking hours working, preparing for work, commuting to work, buying clothes for work, thinking about work, and so on.  That&#8217;s half of your life.  First of all, whatever purpose you have on this earth, don&#8217;t spend half of it doing something that makes you unhappy.  Second, no matter how stoic you are, there is no way that what happens in half of your life doesn&#8217;t affect the other half.  When people are unhappy at work, you can tell.  They don&#8217;t have that energy and excitement that people do when they are happy.  They are more irritable, more negative, they drink and eat too much, and eventually adopt a sort of fatalistic attitude.  It&#8217;s sad.  Timothy Ferriss did a much better analysis of this in <a href="http://www.thefourhourworkweek.com/">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>, and while I don&#8217;t agree with everything in the book, he hits the nail on the head on this (and some other) issues.</p>

<p><strong>5. You&#8217;ve probably heard the old saying that &#8220;the only way to get what you want is to help others get what they want&#8221;.  How important is this idea of &#8220;helping others&#8221; in the founding of <a href="http://www.lovesystems.com/">Love Systems</a> or any company?</strong></p>

<p>The whole basis behind dating coaching is about helping others.  We help men succeed with women.  So for <a href="http://www.lovesystems.com/">Love Systems</a> we don&#8217;t succeed if our clients don&#8217;t succeed.  We don&#8217;t have millions to spend on advertising and we guarantee everything we sell with a full refund if clients aren&#8217;t satisfied.  If we don&#8217;t genuinely help others, we die.  That might sound scary, but it&#8217;s not; it&#8217;s highly motivating. It&#8217;s really fun to be in a business where our interests are directly aligned with those of our clients.  Now we&#8217;re also helping women succeed with men and it&#8217;s the same principle at play.</p>

<p><strong>6. Can you tell us about a company or project you&#8217;ve started that failed, and what you learned from it?  How do you deal with &#8220;failure&#8221; or risk of failure as an entrepreneur?</strong></p>

<p>Test and learn isn&#8217;t just a direct marketing philosophy, it&#8217;s how we run the whole business.  The important thing to keep in mind when trying something new is to set your failure conditions beforehand.  If I&#8217;m going to put one month, or X dollars, or whatever resource into a project or opportunity, I want to have a sense before I get started and emotionally committed to it, what would constitute a failure.  It&#8217;s like investing in a stock.  If I buy at $60, I may decide to sell it if it drops to $50.  It&#8217;s all too easy to hold on and hope for a rebound. After all, if it was a good investment at $60, isn&#8217;t it a better investment at $50?  But you can go broke, or waste years of your life, if you let little losses pile up.  Yeah, $49 isn&#8217;t that different from $50.  And $48 isn&#8217;t that different from $49.  But eventually the stock is trading at $10, and at some point you have to realize you got it wrong.  Same thing with startups.  When <a href="http://www.lovesystems.com/">Love Systems</a> Corporation was formed, I gave it a year.  I knew that in a year if it didn&#8217;t work out, I&#8217;d still have my contacts and be marketable.  Fortunately, it succeeded.  If it hadn&#8217;t, I wouldn&#8217;t have let it drag on into year 5. There&#8217;s nothing magic about one year, of course, some businesses need a greater or lesser time horizon.  But the important thing is to set your failure conditions before you start.</p>

<p><strong>7. What&#8217;s the one thing you know now that you wish you knew when you were first starting your career?</strong></p>

<p>Most jobs are not like school.  You don&#8217;t disappear from the professor&#8217;s view, write great paper, hand it in, and have it graded objectively.  In my first job, I ignored many opportunities to socialize or build relationships in my company in order to spend more &#8220;work time&#8221; producing better work.  And I did produce better work, and my career went fine. But it could have gone so much better with 90% of the efficiency and more time spent managing relationships and being part of the team.  Work isn&#8217;t fair.  It&#8217;s not meant to be fair.</p>

<p><strong>8. Do you ever see yourself going back to a &#8220;real job&#8221; working for someone else?  What does the future have in store?</strong></p>

<p>Some people say they couldn&#8217;t do that after being an entrepreneur.  I don&#8217;t know if that holds true for me.  I think as long as I was working with great people and had appropriate incentives and the autonomy and tools to achieve them, I could do just as well in the corporate world. The fun of doing what I&#8217;m doing now doesn&#8217;t come from being &#8220;the boss&#8221;. I defer to other members of the management team a lot, usually when they are closer to a specific issue or feel strongly about it.  I focus on a couple areas of responsibility and have overall accountability, but in a way it would also be nice not to be the person ultimately accountable for every single issue.  That being said, I love what I&#8217;m doing now and wouldn&#8217;t change it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A question from a reader:</p>

<blockquote><p>Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>Love your blog. I&#8217;m devouring the information.</p>

<p>I really want to get into the property market and have a little saved for a down payment.</p>

<p>However, in my state (Australia) I have only been able to find 2 deals that has positive cash flow in the last 6 months. I put an offer in on one of them but didn&#8217;t get it. It was subsequently sold at a higher price that made it negative cash flow. The other was bought day 1. The rest are negative where I would have to pay weekly repayments. Not good.</p>

<p>Perhaps Im looking in the wrong places. Perhaps Im not thinking out side the square.</p>

<p>I would love some help!</p>

<p>Cheers,
O.P.</p>

<p>Hi O.P.,</p>

<p>Your dilemma reminds me of what I was looking at 6 months ago.  I looked at a ton of houses before I finally found one that cash flowed. I felt really lucky to find that one deal and I thought it would be equally hard to find another one.</p>

<p>But I was totally wrong, because once I got a couple of good mentors, and they showed me a few things, I realized that on any given day in the city there were probably 20 or 30 good deals that would cash flow. They would go fast, and a few days later, 20 more would be there. I&#8217;m serious&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t believe it at first.  I still meet guys almost every week who I talk to and they tell me &#8220;I tried that and there are no good deals&#8221;.  They are totally convinced just like I was.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know your particular market, and the tools to be used there are probably different.  But I can tell you this&#8230;don&#8217;t try to figure it out on your own.  Spend the next month or so just trying to find a good mentor.</p>

<p>Find someone who is earning a really good living from real estate, and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask them tough questions like what their net worth is, how much passive income they make each month from real estate etc. Then just be perfectly honest and tell them that you have <em>no idea what you are doing</em>, but that you are very eager to learn, and if they have any suggestions you would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>Then do what they say and report back to them.  They will probably give you some little test (a book to read, a test to take, etc) to see if you are serious.  Invest the time.</p>

<p>This is how I got the CEO of the largest commercial real estate company in Houston to be my mentor, and (partially) how I got my other mentor who owns over 2000 units in Houston.</p>

<p>Best of luck!
Brian</p>
