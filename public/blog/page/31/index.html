  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/comments1231.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/comments1231-150x150.png" alt="Engaging Readers In Discussion On Blogs" /></a>This is day 16 of my 30 day marketing challenge to get more readers on this website and make more money.  This is a live demonstration of how to <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">build a blog business</a>!</p>

<p>Some of my contributing articles have started to appear, including part 2 of my <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/07/04/rss-to-email-comparison-review-feedblitz/">rss-to-email review of FeedBlitz</a>, my <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/why-you-need-to-be-a-toastmaster.html">LifeHack.org article on why you need to be in Toastmasters</a> (it&#8217;s a non profit group that teaches public speaking), and a similar (Toastmasters) article on <a href="http://mindpetals.com/blog/2007/07/five-reasons-all-entrepreneurs-should-join-toastmasters/">MindPetals.com (an entrepreneurship site)</a>.</p>

<p>Notice that I sent different articles on LifeHack.org and MindPetals.com, even though they were on similar topics.  The reason I did this was that both sites prefer unique content.  Google rewards unique content.  As an interesting side note, I&#8217;ve noticed that writing it once, and totally rewriting it again from scratch makes the second copy much better!  Can you tell which one was written second? ;)</p>

<p>My three marketing tasks for today are&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trying to engage the readers in more conversation.  I&#8217;m starting to get quite a few comments on this site, and i spent this morning answering many of them.  I also got a phone call from very nice woman who had a question, and we talked at length.  I also got an interview request from <a href="http://alltipsandtricks.com/">Simonne over at AllTipsAndTricks.com (a top 100k site)</a>.  Finally, i sent an offer to talk on the phone to Joel at <a href="http://joelbadinas.com/">JoelBadinas.com</a> since we seem to be on a similar path.  Connecting with more bloggers and providing a personal touch to the website as much as possible will really pay off I think.</p></li>
<li><p>I have an interview today at 4pm central on <a href="http://www.globaltalkradio.com/shows/callingallauthors/">Calling All Authors</a> - a radio show through the people at Nightingale Press.  You can listen live online as I discuss my book and <a href="http://www.globaltalkradio.com/live/index.asx">how easy it is to start a business</a>.  I&#8217;ll also post a recording of it in a few days in case you missed it.  Note that this interview is a result of some work I did many months ago.  A friend of mine who is an author recommended that website, and they were booked for four months, so I am just now appearing.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="http://www.income.com/blog/2007/07/02/open-your-eyes-and-find-the-gold/">John Reese&#8217;s latest video from Income.com</a>.  He demonstrates a technique in which you can use <a href="http://adwords.google.com">adwords</a> to see how much traffic your competitors are getting (at least the ones that use <a href="http://adsense.google.com">adsense</a>), and then partner with the best ones.  Well, I did what John suggested and searched for sites related to starting a business.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Remarkably, the site with the most traffic was this little unassuming website called <a href="http://www.wahm.com/">WAHM.com</a> (stands for work at home moms).  According to Google they get between 100-500 thousand page views per day!!!  Thats more than Entrepreneur.com, which is the website of Entrepreneur Magazine (it&#8217;s very popular but is a pretty bad magazine by the way, subscribe to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0JGQO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000P0JGQO">Business 2.0</a> instead).</p>

<p>Anyway, I made an attempt to contact the owner of WAHM.com (Cheryl) by offering to create a video or article for them on how to quickly set up a business website.  Hopefully by offering value I can get in touch with them and get a partnership going.</p>

<p>The WAHM.com website is not professionally designed, and I never would have guessed they were getting so much traffic (they&#8217;re easily earning $1000/day in Adsense alone I imagine).  Thanks John for the tip.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/toastmasterslogo1.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/toastmasterslogo1-150x150.gif" alt="Toastmasters" /></a>Today is day 15 of my 30 day challenge to <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">bring more <em>readers</em> to this blog</a>, and demonstrate that blogging can be a profitable business.</p>

<p>By the way, Darren posted the first part of my <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/07/03/rss-to-email-comparison-review-feedburner-feedblitz-zookoda-aweber/">review on Rss-to-Email providers</a>.</p>

<p>My three tasks for today were:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Finished the article on Toastmasters for <a href="http://www.mindpetals.com/">MindPetals.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>I had a great conversation with Liz Strauss of <a href="http://www.successful-blog.com/">Successful-blog.com</a>.  She contacted me based on my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-13-successful-and-outstanding-bloggers-list-backlinks-advice-from-yaro-and-dmoz/">Day 13 post</a> and gave a new perspective on blogging.  As she put it, some bloggers are marketing people, and some are relationships people.  Liz is a big proponent of the relationships type, since this is blogging&#8217;s biggest strength.  Some things that I got out of it were:</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t think about &#8216;traffic&#8217;, think about &#8216;readers&#8217;</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t do a report, just talk about your own personal experience</p></li>
<li><p>A news article ends by making a point or coming to a conclusion, but blog should generate discussion and be interactive.  It&#8217;s is not one person&#8217;s thoughts, it is many people&#8217;s thoughts.</p></li>
<li><p>To generate discussion there are a number of things you can do&#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>Be authentic and let them know there is a real person behind the blog</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t always end the post with an answer, leave an open ended question</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage readers to contribute their own ideas, the community will generate more insight than one person</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, these were just a few ideas.  It was good to meet a more successful blogger and actually speak to them on the phone (so far I&#8217;ve only emailed back and forth with a few).  I hope to go to some blogging conferences in the future and meet more of them face to face!</p>

<ol>
<li>I wrote and submitted my next LifeHack.org contributing article which was due yesterday!</li>
</ol>


<p>Contributing articles to other sites has still been my biggest generator of subscribers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/616726_handshake1.jpg" alt="Business Education Through Networking" />A few days ago I told you about a trick I use to <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-education-how-to-devour-at-least-one-business-book-per-week-without-taking-any-additional-time-out-of-your-day/">get more learning done every day</a>: I listen to audio books while I&#8217;m driving around town, exercising, and traveling.  And it allows me to finish a book per week that I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have time to read.</p>

<p>Then I told you about a trick I use to get more reading done: <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-education-part-2-speed-reading/">speed reading and speed comprehension</a>.  Yes it is real, and I was able to double my reading rate in one month.  Anyone can do the same, in fact you may be able to do even better!</p>

<p>Well today I&#8217;m going to tell you about the third and final way I get more learning done every day.  Like the previous two tips, this one happens AUTOMATICALLY.  In other words, I don&#8217;t have to take any additional time out of my day to get the benefit.  It is built into my life so that it happens no matter what, which is the real power.</p>

<p>The secret is this: I surround myself with successful people.</p>

<p>In other words, I make friends with people who are knowledgeable, full of great ideas, and happy to share them.</p>

<p>When I spend time with my friends, we inevitably talk about the work we&#8217;ve been doing, what&#8217;s been working, what hasn&#8217;t been working, and what we&#8217;re excited about.  These discussions always leave me feeling either inspired about the success they are experiencing, or with new ideas that I can apply to my own business.</p>

<p>Quick story: I recently went to go see a speaker named Chris Wasden, who is a successful entrepreneur and founded several medical device companies.  His talk was informative and insightful, and afterwards I ran into an old friend.  We caught up over a cup of coffee, discussed the speech, and talked a bit about her new accounting business.  Just as we were wrapping things up, she casually mentioned that she had put up a post on craigslist.com, a free classified website.  She said it had been an effective way to bring in new business for her, and she suggested I give it a try.</p>

<p>Well, I promptly went home and put up a quick post (it was entirely free) and by the END OF THE DAY I had new client for my own business.</p>

<p>That was money in my pocket, just because of a quick conversation with a friend.</p>

<p>I knew about that particular website, craigslist.com, before our discussion that day, but it took a conversation with a good friend to remind me to actually use it!</p>

<p>But it wasn&#8217;t just any friend.  It was a friend with similar interests, who was successful, positive, and willing to share.</p>

<p>Most people do the opposite: they spend time with their same old friends, who are stuck in their same old jobs, and have few aspirations in life.  It is quite literally impossible to spend time with negative or unsuccessful people, and NOT have it rub off on you.</p>

<p>So make an effort to surround yourself with people who know more than you do.  Find friends who are entrepreneurs.  Find friends who are positive.  And find friends who are willing to share their ideas.  They will AUTOMATICALLY start pushing you toward owning a successful business, whether you like it or not!</p>

<p>With these three secrets, I hope you start getting more learning done EVERY DAY.  Remember: listen to audio books, learn to speed read, and surround yourself with successful people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/mindpetals1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/mindpetals1-150x150.png" alt="MindPetals Young Entrepreneur Network" /></a>It&#8217;s day 14 of my 30 day challenge to <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">build traffic to my blog</a>.  As you recall, I&#8217;m proving that blogging can be a profitable business anyone can start via live demonstration!</p>

<p>Today I&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wrote the draft of an article for David Askaripour&#8217;s <a href="http://mindpetals.com/">MindPetals.com</a>.  Its about <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmaster&#8217;s</a>, a public speaking club, and why I think everyone who is interested in starting a business should join.  I&#8217;ll provide a link once it goes live on the site.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve been battling my hosting company <a href="http://1and1.com">1and1</a> to fix the performance problems with the server.  I notice it being frequently slow (although never down) to the point where I imagine many users get frustrated and leave.  I&#8217;ve asked them to be moved to a different shared server (sometimes one bad apple on a particular shared server can wreck the experience for everyone), but they don&#8217;t seem to do this without big cause, so I&#8217;m staying on them.  What has been your experience with the speed of browsing StartBreakingFree.com?</p></li>
<li><p>I spent some time today checking progress in terms of back links and indexing in both Google and Yahoo.  As of today Google shows only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=xKM&amp;q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com&amp;btnG=Search">7 people linking to this site</a> (most of which are no-name sites), which I find rather bizarre because <a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/search?p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com&amp;bwm=i&amp;bwms=p&amp;bwmf=u&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;fr2=seo-rd-se">Yahoo is showing 4264 incoming links</a> at the time of this writing (many from important high PR sites).  I&#8217;d heard that Google had a higher standard for what they considered an incoming link, but they seem to be counting poor links and missing some of the best ones.  Finally, it looks like only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=http://www.startbreakingfree.com+site:www.startbreakingfree.com+">two pages of this website</a> are indexed in Google while <a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/advsearch?p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com&amp;bwm=p&amp;bwmf=u">Yahoo has indexed 53 pages</a>.  I have the Google sitemaps plugin installed for Wordpress and an Archive/Sitemap page at the top (both of which should help Google index the entire site).  I&#8217;m hoping this is just a temporary side effect of my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-7-link-structure-pings-mybloglog/">changing the link structure</a> that will be resolved soon!</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/dmoz1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/dmoz1-150x150.png" alt="Entrepreneurship section of DMOZ" /></a>This is lucky day number 13 of my 30 day challenge to drive more <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">traffic to this website</a> and prove that blogging can be profitable!</p>

<p>Notice how I put the link on &#8220;traffic to this website&#8221; since it includes some better keywords than &#8220;30 day challenge&#8221;.  I&#8217;m trying to include more keywords in links.</p>

<p>My three tasks for the day were&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I sent Liz a note to see if I could get on her list of <a href="http://successful-blog.com/successful-and-outstanding-bloggers/">Successful and Outstanding Bloggers</a>.  A very creative idea Liz!  And she is spot on that developing relationships with other bloggers seems to be the best way to market you blog.  This has certainly been my experience so far!</p></li>
<li><p>I started reading Yaro Starak&#8217;s post on the the 80/20 rule of <a href="http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/331/search-engine-marketing-part-1/">search engine marketing for blogs</a>.  In particular I liked his section on internal links, so I put three internal links at the bottom of each page (in the footer) that include my targeted keywords.  Thanks Yaro!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>By the way, Yaro has a <a href="http://www.blogmastermind.com/">Blog Mastermind group</a> that I&#8217;m considering joining.  Yaro earns over $75k per year just from blogging, and I&#8217;m sure I could learn a lot from him.</p>

<ol>
<li>Also based on Yaro&#8217;s blog marketing article, I decided to try submitting my site to the DMOZ directory in the <a href="http://dmoz.org/Business/Small_Business/Start_Up/Entrepreneurship/">entrepreneurship</a> section.  The DMOZ pages tend to be high page rank.</li>
</ol>


<p>Finally, I told you I&#8217;d report on what happened with the StumbleUpon advertising campaign.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/like1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/like1.png" alt="Entrepreneurs like this website" /></a>Overall it looks like people generally liked the website.  An average of 3.7% of people voted that they liked it, compared to only 0.5% who voted that they didn&#8217;t.  That means more than 7 times as many people liked it as didn&#8217;t, and it also means that 96% of people don&#8217;t vote.</p>

Overall I&#8217;d say the quality of traffic from StumbleUpon wasn&#8217;t great, based on this limited test.</p>

<p>My three tasks for the day were&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-11-article-for-probloggernet-stumbleupon-campaign-and-longer-domain-registration-attempt/">Yesterday</a> I couldn&#8217;t get my web host to extend my domain registration.  But based on a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-11-article-for-probloggernet-stumbleupon-campaign-and-longer-domain-registration-attempt/#comments">comment</a> by a reader, I accomplished this through GoDaddy.com today.  My domain is now registered for 9 years.  Thanks!</p></li>
<li><p>Sent out 10 more link exchange requests through <a href="http://www.linkmachine.net/trk.php?ID=2328">LinkMachine</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Did another search on <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> for related blogs and submitted an article to <a href="http://startupspark.com/">Startup Spark</a> and <a href="http://www.tylercruz.com/">Tyler Cruz&#8217;s Blog</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>My Stumble Upon advertising is almost done ($4 of my original $50 budget is left).  I will report tomorrow on how effective it was and the feedback I got from Stumble Upon viewers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Michael Masterson from Early To Rise wrote a <a href="http://www.earlytorise.com/2007/06/29/do-you-have-what-it-takes.html">great article</a> (you&#8217;ll have to scroll down a bit) on mentality behind entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Many people assume they don&#8217;t have what it takes because they aren&#8217;t risk takers.  Risk-loving and entrepreneurship do not go hand in hand.  In fact, it turns out that often the most successful entrepreneurs are those best at minimizing risk.</p>

<blockquote><p>The natural entrepreneur is good at coming up with ideas, but not so good at following up on them. &#8220;I’m an idea person,&#8221; such entrepreneurs will tell you. &#8220;I’m not good with details.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In saying that, these people are suggesting that the ability to come up with ideas is more important than the skill of implementing them. But as Robert Ringer says in Action!, no idea has any value until it is carried out. The secret of success in business is the ability to combine innovation and implementation.</p>

<p>If, like my friend PG, you have been putting off the decision to strike out on your own because you don’t know if you have &#8220;what it takes,&#8221; consider the case I am making here: If having what it takes means having the classic entrepreneurial personality, you may be better off with the personality you have.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.earlytorise.com/2007/06/29/do-you-have-what-it-takes.html">article here</a> (scroll down till you see &#8220;Do You Have What It Takes?&#8221;).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/probloggr2341.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/probloggr2341-150x150.png" alt="ProBlogger.net website contains articles and tips for making money with your blog" /></a>This is day 11 of my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">30 day marketing challenge</a> where I&#8217;m demonstrating how blogging can be a profitable business to start.</p>

<p>My three tasks for the day were:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I wrote an article for Darren&#8217;s <a href="http://www.problogger.net">ProBlogger.net</a> website about the various RSS-to-Email services that are available today.  I used this same technique to get a contributing author position at Lifehack.org and it has been a huge traffic generator.  So I emailed Darren with a quick note (he gets tons of email) asking him if I could contribute this article to his blog (notice I focused on what was in it for him).  Now that its written I&#8217;m going to give it a once over later today, and send it to him.  Hopefully it will appear in a few days (it&#8217;s over 6 pages single space in MS word, so he may break it up into multiple posts).  And of course it includes my by line at the bottom which is how I get traffic to this website.</p></li>
<li><p>I funded my StumbleUpon advertisers account so that I can try driving some traffic from them.  I started with $50, and at $.05 per click that will be 1000 visitors.  I will track how many of them turn into subscribers and report back.</p></li>
<li><p>I made an effort today to extend the length of domain registration.  Apparently Google gives preference to domains which have been registered for a long time.  However, my web host provider was less than helpful in accomplishing this.  I wasn&#8217;t sure what their tech support address was, so I sent a request and included a couple CC&#8217;s.  It just so happens I got back 3 replies from 3 different people to the same question.  Two of them clearly didn&#8217;t understand what I was asking at all, and the third understood but couldn&#8217;t make the request.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Here was my request:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard that Google gives preference to websites that have
registered their domains for longer periods of time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to register mine for longer if possible.  How can I do this?</p>

<p>Thank you!
Brian Armstrong</p></blockquote>

<p>And here were the three replies:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you for contacting us.</p></blockquote>

<p>Try to visit Google AdWords. It&#8217;s an outside system under Google that
allows you to stay on their SEO for a longer time./</p>

<p>If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p>&#8211;
Sincerely,

1&amp;1 Internet</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t true, it&#8217;s not what I was asking, and &#8220;stay on their SEO&#8221; makes no sense.</p>

<p>Second response:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you for contacting us.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you want to register your domain into google search engine, all you
need to do
is submit your domain through 1and1 application which is simple
submission. On
how to do a simple submission you can refer on the link below:</p>

<p>http://faq.1and1.com/applications/simple_submission__simple_seo/2.html</p>

<p>If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p>&#8211;
Sincerely,
Ariel Contreras
Technical Support
1&amp;1 Internet</p>

<p>Not what I was asking at all, and I&#8217;m already in Google.  Third response&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you for contacting us.</p></blockquote>

<p>We only have 1 year domain registration. We automatically renew it every
year. We don&#8217;t have that kind of offer.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p>&#8211;
Sincerely,
Elmer Salupan
Technical Support
1&amp;1 Internet</p>

<p>Not helpful but at least Elmer understood the question!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been relatively happy with 1and1 hosting in the past, but recent events (slow server, failure to support the latest PHP and MySQL, and this event) have made me not want to recommend them to anyone.</p>

<p>Anyway, since that didn&#8217;t go very well, and I wanted to complete my third task for the day.  I typed &#8220;marketing&#8221; into <a href="http://www.technorati.com">technorati</a> and found an interesting <a href="http://www.shoemoney.com">blog</a> where the guy is making some amazing amounts of money off of Adsense.  You can see a picture of him holding a <a href="http://www.shoemoney.com/gallery/v/misc/adsensecheck.jpg.html">check</a> from Google for over $100 grand.  I sent him a link to this article series in hopes of a backlink.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait for the next Google update (they seem to do it about once per month).  I&#8217;m going to have a ton more links and I&#8217;m hoping to get a bump in page rank and search listings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/809587_bookmark_11.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/809587_bookmark_11-150x150.jpg" alt="Speed Reading" /></a>A few days ago I told you about the secret I use to get <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-education-how-to-devour-at-least-one-business-book-per-week-without-taking-any-additional-time-out-of-your-day/">more learning done each week than most people do in a month</a>: audio books.</p>

<p>Well today, I&#8217;m going to share the second secret I use to getting more learning done, and this one works well even if you aren&#8217;t an &#8220;audio learner&#8221;.  If you learn best by actually seeing words on a page, instead of hearing someone speak, then this will work well for you.</p>

<p>The secret is: speed reading.  Yes, it is real and it works.  In fact, it&#8217;s not just speed reading, but speed comprehension too.</p>

<p>Before I learned this, I always had the assumption that speed reading was bogus, or that people were basically skimming the material without getting full comprehension.</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m here to tell you that it in fact is real, and it does work.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a simple explanation of how:</p>

<p>When you first started reading you had to look at each letter in a word and sound them out, right?  &#8220;C&#8221; sounded like &#8220;cuh&#8221;, &#8220;A&#8221; sounded like &#8220;ah&#8221;, and &#8220;T&#8221; sounded like &#8220;tuh&#8221;.  That spelled &#8220;cat&#8221;.</p>

<p>But eventually, as your reading improved, you didn&#8217;t have to look at each letter.  You could just look at the whole word and your brain would instantly recognize &#8220;cat&#8221;.</p>

<p>Your brain did this on it&#8217;s own without any special training.</p>

<p>Well, in the same way that you don&#8217;t have to look at each letter to read a word, speed readers don&#8217;t have to look at each word to read a sentence.  They can look at a phrase, or entire sentence, and just SEE it all at once.  High speed cameras can be used to watch the eyes of speed readers and see that they only have one or two focal points per sentence or even paragraph!</p>

<p>This sounds difficult, like you would need some genius ability to accomplish it, but almost anyone can do it with practice.  With a series of exercises you can slowly retrain how your brain reads.</p>

<p>Reportedly, John F. Kennedy was able to read at an incredible pace, and there have been a number of other famous speed readers throughout history.  But one thing is for sure: the benefits are enormous.</p>

<p>If you could just double your reading rate (which is what I was able to do in one month), then you are now able to cover twice as much material in a given day.  Either that, or you can do the same material you are doing now in half the time!</p>

<p>There are two ways you can learn to speed read.  What I did was take a self taught course, using this book which I&#8217;d recommend on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/073520019X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=073520019X">speed reading</a>.</p>

<p>I did a series of exercises that took about a half hour per day, for one month.  At the end of that time, my reading rate had doubled (with the same level of retention, which is tested as well).  My reading rate continues to grow today.</p>

<p>To be honest, it was not easy to do those exercises.  Some days it was boring, and I really didn&#8217;t want to do them.  But I&#8217;m so glad that I did, because doing those for one month, gave me an incredible investment in myself that will repay itself MANY times over for the rest of my life!</p>

<p>Of course, if you don&#8217;t feel like you have the discipline to make yourself do all those exercises, you can always take a local speed reading course, which I highly recommend as well.</p>

<p>If you read for an average of one hour per day, then speed reading is like getting an extra hour of reading done every day. How would your life be different if you read for an extra 365 hours every year, for the rest of your life?  What would you do with all that extra knowledge?  All those extra books?  I have no way of knowing, but it sure is exciting to think about.  You owe it to yourself to learn to speed read, so get started today! This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/073520019X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=073520019X">book</a> is a good place if you have the dicipline, or you could sign up for a speed reading class.</p>

<p>Either way, if this sounds exciting, take some action RIGHT NOW to make it happen before you have a chance to forget.</p>

<p>In the next post in this series, I&#8217;ll share with you one final tip I use to get more learning done EVERY day, without spending any additional time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/reciprocallinks2341.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/reciprocallinks2341-150x150.gif" alt="Reciprocal Links For Blog Marketing" /></a>This is day 10 of my 30 day <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">marketing challenge</a> to demonstrate that blogging can be an inexpensive and profitable business to start.</p>

<p>Note that I got a permanent link to my website from John Reese&#8217;s Income.com Blog <a href="http://www.income.com/blog/2007/06/27/blog-seo-follow-up/#more-39">here</a> based on the advice I sent him.  There are a bunch of links on that page, but still, it will gain page rank over time and every little bit helps.</p>

<p>Here are the 3 tasks I completed today&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>I went through my <a href="http://www.linkmachine.net/trk.php?ID=2328">LinkMachine</a> program and looked at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">page rank</a> of all the people I was linking too.  About ten of them had a page of 1 or &#8220;n/a&#8221;, so I removed them.  The ones with &#8220;n/a&#8221; in particular are bad because that means Google dropped them from their directory.  Google drops websites for behaving badly and it can actually hurt MY rankings by the fact that I link to them.  The logic goes..if I have links to crappy websites, then I must be crappy.  Hopefully removing those will improve my rankings.</li>
</ol>


<p>By the way, it&#8217;s interesting to note that the opposite (crappy websites linking to you) can never hurt your page rank.  This becomes obvious when you consider that I can&#8217;t control who links to me, and Google should never punish me for what isn&#8217;t under my control.  You can also imagine a scenario where some malicious person who wants to hurt your website creates a ton of unlisted pages in Google and makes them all link to you.  Google doesn&#8217;t want to make that possible, so they don&#8217;t penalize for who links to you, only who you link to (might have to read that a few times ;).</p>

<ol>
<li>In an attempt to get a listing on <a href="http://paulamooney.blogspot.com/2007/05/paulas-list-of-blogger-salariesare-you.html">this website</a> which lists bloggers salaries, I will give you a little update on my progress.  This blog was started almost one month ago to date.  It is currently averaging about 300-400 page views per day.  My biggest day so far was over 2000 page views.  Adsense income is about $2.50 per day, and I&#8217;m averaging about 1 book sale per day.  I also have a <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com/">Text Link Ads</a> account installed on this page, which is another way to earn money, but no one has purchased a link yet.  I&#8217;ve gained 298 RSS subscribers in the past month, bringing the total to 834 (a large number of people on my original email list did not stay with me in the transition).  Anyway, at my current level, this blog is earning $5639 per year.  After being on the internet for only one month, I think this is outstanding.  With my current rate of growth, I&#8217;m sure it will be well beyond that in the coming months.</li>
</ol>


<p>Hopefully this post information will be enough to get another back link to my site from <a href="http://paulamooney.blogspot.com/2007/05/paulas-list-of-blogger-salariesare-you.html">Paula&#8217;s list of Blog Salaries</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>I added some code to track where my RSS and email subscribers are coming from in Google Analytics using Francesco Mapelli brilliant <a href="http://www.mapelli.info/blog/how-to-use-google-analytics-to-track-feed-subscriptions-and-everything-else">tutorial</a>.  I&#8217;m going to give it a day or so to make sure its working.  Then I can launch my StumbleUpon.com paid advertising and track how many of those visitors subscribe (a measure of the quality of the traffic).</li>
</ol>


<p>I&#8217;m doing a pretty good job so far of getting keywords into the title, url, h1, and meta tags, but I realized while reading Darren&#8217;s article on <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/08/15/search-engine-optimization-for-blogs/">search engine optimization for blogs</a> that in future posts I should get those keywords into outgoing links, alt tags, and bold tags as well.</p>
