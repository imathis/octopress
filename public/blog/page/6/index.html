  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was watching <a href="https://www.openforum.com/idea-hub/topics/marketing/video/made-to-stick-how-to-stand-out-in-a-crowded-marketplace?">this video</a> today about how to stand out in your market place.  It gives some good examples of companies (like VooDoo Donut and ZipCar) who created a strong following by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Doing something different</li>
<li>Having fun</li>
<li>Not being afraid to be a little weird</li>
</ol>


<p>It reminded me of Google&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling lucky&#8221; button or Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/19/once-again-facebook-owns-talk-like-a-pirate-day-on-the-web/">Pirate</a> language setting.</p>

<p>It also reminded me of some of the ideas I wrote about in <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-generate-word-of-mouth-for-your-business/">word of mouth marketing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Then I started looking at the </strong><a href="http://BuyersVote.com"><strong>BuyersVote.com</strong></a><strong> homepage and I got sort of sad.  It looked really boring.</strong></p>

<p>It looked like every other review site out there.  If I saw it for the first time, I&#8217;d probably be sort of confused, do a few clicks, and then leave.</p>

<p>So I started wondering, what is this website actually ABOUT damnit.  It&#8217;s got to convey it instantly.  And I blurted out &#8220;it just so you can find out if something sucks or not before you buy it!&#8221;</p>

<p>So I decided to change the tag-line of the site from &#8220;Online product reviews made easy&#8221; to &#8220;Find out if it sucks, before you buy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Irreverent?  Yes.  Junevile?  Probably.  Fun and engaging?  I think so.  At least it would cause me to give it a second look, and maybe even participate in this community - it&#8217;s sounds fun.</p>

<p>What do you think?  Worst idea ever or good marketing?  I think I&#8217;ll test it out for a bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a question from a Breaking Free reader&#8230;.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>Your book inspired me to start up my own business based on your Start Breaking Free model.</p>

<p>I was a lawyer working 80 hour weeks at an international firm, doomed to spending the best years of my life behind a desk. I was depressed and my confidence was taking a battering from my unhappy, over critical, negative, unhealthy and institutionalized colleagues.</p>

<p>After reading your book I started to ponder how, if at all, I could escape the rat race.</p>

<p>My answer came a few short weeks after reading your book. If I was working 80 hours a week and making less than a third of my billing target, where was the rest of the money going? After weeks of research I found out that it was going to a combination of a) the under worked over paid partners b) the lazy and inefficient staff and c) the office, stationary, IT and other such expenses.</p>

<p>I decided to setup a service that has none of these expenses and that offers lawyers a better life and businesses a cheaper more efficient service. I set up Matrix Law Group which places lawyers with businesses on a temporary employee basis and which allows those lawyers to work either remotely or from the business&#8217; office (so no office).</p>

<p>I advertise in a few small business publications over here and then hire someone, including myself out (like a temp agency) and charge businesses a low hourly rate (we have no overheads so can undercut traditional law firms). I now work about about 7 to 10 hours a week at £100 an hour and because of more favourable tax treatments, I make a decent wage but a less than I did when I was working 80 hours a week. But guess what? I am much much happier and healthier.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t lie, getting business is not easy, specially since I have to do all my marketing myself.</p>

<p>My question to you is whether you can offer me any advice on marketing myself and my business? My website is <a href="http://www.matrixlawgroup.com">www.matrixlawgroup.com</a>, other than that, and a few adverts, I have no other marketing tools. Law is one of those industries that works on a word of mouth basis. I am therefore trying to approach people, such as yourself, to get advice.</p>

<p>Thank you for inspiring me to change my life.</p>

<p>Keep breaking free.
Patrick</p>

<p>Hey Patrick,</p>

<p>Wow I love it!  I think it&#8217;s a great idea and will save people lots of money (the perfect sales pitch at this time).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if you designed the site like this intentionally, but it came across somewhat web 2.0 ish or futuristic.  At least for me I&#8217;d prefer to see something more professional and old fashioned looking for a legal site, that instills a sense of quality.  Up to you of course, just thought I&#8217;d mention it.  Did you think about listing the available lawyers on the site as well with some sort of profile?</p>

<p>Anyway, I think you&#8217;re off to a great start. I actually thought about doing something similar a while back (the UniversityTutor of lawyers sort of thing) but decided to focus just on tutors right now.  As for marketing, a couple things come to mind&#8230;start blogging, put in the title long tail keywords which you may rank for easier at first (less competitive).  Make blog posts naming specific companies and how they could improve their legal costs.  By calling them out publicly you can get some attention/controversy.  Maybe even make outrageous challenges&#8230;for example, you can publicly offer to complete some legal task for free for someone, just to prove how much lower your costs (number of hours) would have been, and then show the work for people to compare quality.</p>

<p>Overall, I think giving away your services for free at first could be great marketing.  Basically&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>get in touch with some business</p></li>
<li><p>ask them what their current legal fees are costing them</p></li>
<li><p>if it&#8217;s a good fit, offer to do the work they were paying these other guys for for FREE for a month</p></li>
<li><p>after that if they aren&#8217;t happy with the results then you part ways, if they are happy then they can consider hiring you at your agreed upon rate (highly likely to happen if you work is good)</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Some people call this risk reversal - essentially removing 100% of the risk for someone to try you out so you can prove the benefit to them.  Charlie Hoehn&#8217;s book, </strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/choehn/recessionproof-graduate-1722966"><strong>Free Work</strong></a><strong>, makes a great case for this.</strong></p>

<p>UPDATE: this <a href="http://mixergy.com/online-promotion/">Mixergy interview with Neil Patel</a> has some great examples of how free work brought in new business.  Neil says &#8220;don&#8217;t charge celebs or high profile people, take publicity/contacts instead of payment&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is just to get started&#8230;once you have some regular customers, the referrals will start coming in.  Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://mixergy.com/about/">Andrew Warner</a> and I put together a little entrepreneur meetup last night which turned out really well.</p>

<p>Well actually, I emailed Andrew when I saw on his blog that he was in Buenos Aires, and he had the great idea to post the meeting to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=940180">Hacker News</a>.  It ended up being a pretty good turnout.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires is turning into quite the little tech entrepreneur scene.  As I wrote on Hacker News&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>It does seem like something is brewing here. I think it got popular with Tim Ferriss&#8217; The Four Hour Work Week where he talks about Buenos Aires&#8230;lots of founders came down here. It&#8217;s easier to bootstrap a web business because:</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>costs are much lower here</p></li>
<li><p>earning in dollars and spending in pesos means your money goes a long way (geo-arbitrage)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s by no means huge yet, but there is a band of renegade expat coder/entrepreneurs I&#8217;ve met up with here that are doing some impressive stuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I met up with a few entrepreneurs from Dublin, Ireland this week in Buenos Aires.  They have a web business based around the <a href="http://www.piehole.ie/JessicaFreed">voiceover</a> industry.  If you don&#8217;t know, the voiceover industry is a bit like acting or modeling in that people typically have agents - except they get hired to record their voice for commercials and things like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVxP33iQ6KM">this</a>.</p>

<p>You can see a sample of one of their pages <a href="http://www.piehole.ie/JessicaFreed">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.piehole.ie/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/11/Picture-11.png" alt="Voiceover" /></a></p>

<p>By the way, their logo looks a bit strange, but apparently that is the tonsils on the back of someone&#8217;s mouth (their piehole).</p>

<p>Really, it&#8217;s a similar business model to UniversityTutor.com or Haystack.com which I&#8217;ve talked about recently.  Simply put, you get a bunch of listings from some sort of service provider, try to get traffic from people who need to find them, and then you charge the service provider a subscription to get work through your site.</p>

<p>The challenge is establishing your site as the dominant one in that niche by getting lots of traffic and good search engine rankings, but once you do it&#8217;s difficult for a new comer to overtake you.  There are high barriers to entry in that sense.</p>

<p>These types of sites aren&#8217;t very complex technologically, but I think they do serve an important purpose: <strong>they are making markets more efficient by eliminating agents.</strong></p>

<p>Seth Godin talked about <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/03/where-have-all-the-agents-gone.html">this idea</a> recently.  Travel agents have largely disappeared because people can buy plane tickets online now.  Stock brokers are disappearing because people can do their own trades online.  Sure, they will continue to exist for a long time in niche businesses where they still provide a valuable service, but they will be nowhere near as common as they used to be.</p>

<p>What other types of agents are going to disappear next?  Real estate agents quite possibly.  Voice over agents.  Tutoring &#8220;agents&#8221; (also known as tutoring companies - but it&#8217;s really the same thing).  The web will be disruptive (in a good way) to a large number of industries.  The service agents provide (helping you find quality among a large number of choices) can increasingly be done with websites.</p>

<p>Is this a bad thing?  Well, if you are one of these agents then from your perspective yes.  But for society as a whole this is absolutely a good thing to &#8220;eliminate the middle man&#8221; and make markets more efficient.  When a 20% commission isn&#8217;t being paid to an agent, the service provider can earn more and the buyer can pay less (a double win).  And eventually the agent is redistributed to a more productive part of the labor market.  It sounds cold to talk about people&#8217;s jobs like that, but it&#8217;s absolutely a net win for society.  Change is inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think of directory sites as a business model?  What will be the next &#8220;middleman&#8221; to go the way of the travel agent?</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Check out this page Ramit Sethi put together about <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/iwtytbr/">getting your finances under control</a>.  It&#8217;s generally great advice and I do quite a lot of it already, like setting up automatic deposits to my ING Direct savings accounts.</p>

<p>Here is an email he got from a reader&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to earn more (I know, who doesn&#8217;t)</p>

<p>I keep reading all these finance books and like any other lazy American, I haven&#8217;t done shit. I&#8217;m 30 and a little behind on saving for the future, plus my boyfriend is a post-doc and not making a ton, so I&#8217;m kinda saving for both of us&#8230; yadda yadda) Essentially, I love the automation idea, I am just not sure how to start automating my life&#8230;</p>

<p>I have the (Roth) 401K, I also have a Roth IRA, but haven&#8217;t set up an automatic deposit into that - I know I should, I&#8217;ve just been sending in the lump sum every year&#8230; bad Leah, bad! Other than those two, I have no idea what to invest in. I like the idea of keeping a close tab on the 401K but let&#8217;s face it, I just put it in a lifecycle fund and haven&#8217;t touched it since. What else do I invest in? Basically, I just want out of the rat race.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>If it sounds familiar then check out what his <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/iwtytbr/">response</a> was.  Financial education is too important to be left to chance.  Speaking of which, have you done your <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-and-create-a-personal-financial-statement-each-month-in-5-minutes/">financial statements</a> for October?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to give an update on how my SEO experiment went from <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-best-books-for-entrepreneurs/">this post a month ago</a>.</p>

<p>For those who didn&#8217;t read it I setup a category on <a href="http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-halloween-costume-ideas-2009-reviews">BuyersVote.com</a> for the best halloween costume ideas of 2009.  I did this because I knew it would be a popular keyword in October, especially toward the end of the month.  And if I could make a good page targeted specifically for that niche keyword, it might get some traffic.</p>

<p>Well, it worked.  I just BARELY got on the first page of Google in time for Halloween and managed to get the 9th or 10th place listing (which is still on the first page) for some costume related keywords.  It was enough to triple the traffic to BuyersVote.com for a month (which isn&#8217;t saying much given how little it was before, but still, you have to start somewhere ;).</p>

<p>Here is the graph from Google Analytics.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/11/Picture-6.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/11/Picture-6.png" alt="SEO Halloween Costumes" /></a></p>

<p>Check out the keywords which drove all the traffic.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that I think my <a href="http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-halloween-costume-ideas-2009-reviews">page</a> actually had the best content of any of the top 10 listings.  Most of the other pages were made-for-adsense sites or crappy articles without many good costume ideas.  It shows you that crowd-sourced content works, even on a small scale.</p>

<p>So what did I learn from this experiment?  Primarily it shows this could be a good growth strategy for BuyersVote.  With just a few good niche review topics like <a href="http://buyersvote.com/categories/u-s-ski-resorts-reviews">Ski Resort Reviews</a>, <a href="http://buyersvote.com/categories/blogs-for-entrepreneurs-reviews">Blogs for Entrepreneurs</a>, or <a href="http://buyersvote.com/categories/web-browsers-for-mac-reviews">Mac Web Browser Reviews</a> it could start to get some good organic search results.  If I get just a few, that will be enough to start getting new contributors to the site who will generate new topics, and new search results, and it will be come a positive feedback loop to growth.</p>

<p>This is the hardest part about starting a site like this: critical mass.  Nobody wants to be the first reviewer on an empty site.</p>

<p>Feel free to steal this SEO idea too (I didn&#8217;t come up with it) and apply it to your own site.  Basically just pick a highly specialized keyword (so it&#8217;s not too competitive) that will have a lot of traffic coming up.  Seasonal or holiday related keywords work well for this.  Then if you generate a page targeted to just that keyword, it&#8217;s possible to get on the first page of Google, even if you have a relatively new or unknown site.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think?  What might be some other good niche topics to add to BuyersVote.com?</strong></p>

<p>By the way, the site now has 405 items and 113 contributors, so if you haven&#8217;t already, please take a moment to <a href="http://buyersvote.com/user_session/new">create an account</a> and add some reviews.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 37Signals guys launched a new site this week called <a href="http://haystack.com/">Haystack.com</a>.  Here is their <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1976-launch-haystack-a-better-way-for-web-designers-to-find-clients-and-for-clients-to-find-web-designers">post</a> explaining the launch.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a simple idea: create a directory of website design companies so clients can quickly find a good one to work with.</p>

<p>The idea is not particularly brilliant and original, but they absolutely nailed the execution on this project.  Let&#8217;s look at a few reasons why this is going to be (and already is) a big success.</p>

<p>At the end I&#8217;ll show you exactly how much money they&#8217;re making from this just a few days after launch (it&#8217;s a lot).</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-10.png" alt="Haystack.com" /></p>

<p><strong>1. It&#8217;s Passive</strong></p>

<p>The first reason this business makes sense is that you build it once and it runs on it&#8217;s own.  You aren&#8217;t trading hours for dollars working with individual clients.  What time you do spent on it after launch is spent ON the business, not IN the business.  This is an important distinction and one of the keys to <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-secret-to-working-less-producing-more-and-getting-rich/">building wealth</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. Freemium</strong></p>

<p>They also used my favorite business model on the web: freemium.  People can try it free, but if you want some additional benefits they ask you to upgrade for $99 per month.</p>

<p>This might be worth it to any web design company who gets at least that much new business from it each month.  It&#8217;s basically a marketing tool for them.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s particularly impressive here is that I think they NAILED the breakdown in benefits between free and paid accounts.  They didn&#8217;t try some gimmicky upgrades like a &#8220;pro&#8221; badge or a 30 day free trial.  Paid accounts get three things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>six images to show your work instead of one (this reminds me of AutoTrader.com)</p></li>
<li><p>listings in search results above free users</p></li>
<li><p>a bigger display of your work than free accounts (the image is 4x as big)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That last one (size) I&#8217;ve never seen in any other freemium model and I think it works great here since they are displaying creative work.</p>

<p>(Side note: another freemium benefit which works really well is an upgrade based on storage, or amount of usage like number of users/projects/invoices sent/etc.  DropBox, Flickr, Evernote, Basecamp, etc all use this with great effect, and it works much better than a 30 day trial or something like that.)</p>

<p><strong>3. Permission Asset: Their Blog</strong></p>

<p>The final reason they nailed this is that they have a lot of clout in this field (website design) and their blog has over 100,000 readers.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate the importance of this.</p>

<p>The site launched just a few days ago and you can already see on the homepage they have 72 paying customers with big listings (and hundreds of free accounts).  <strong>That means the site is already generating over $7,128 per month in profit and it&#8217;s just a few days old.</strong></p>

<p>What would it have cost to buy this much interest in advertising dollars in just a few days?  $100k?  $500k?  I have no idea.  Maybe it wouldn&#8217;t even be possible.  People don&#8217;t put much faith in ads and $99/month is a lot of money.  But they got this &#8220;advertising&#8221; for FREE just by making one blog post.  Of course it took them years to built up that asset (their blog) to get it there.  And they didn&#8217;t fake it by writing cookie cutter, me too, articles.  They wrote really useful stuff from the heart.</p>

<p>The message is clear: if you don&#8217;t have a blog, you need to create one today and start building a relationship with people who know and trust you.  Communicate as personally and authentically as possible.  That way, the next time you are doing something important (a talk, a new business, a book, etc) you have a built in audience.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>As someone who has a similar business - after all <a href="http://www.UniversityTutor.com">UniversityTutor.com</a> is just another directory site, I&#8217;m providing tutors with a way to get new business instead of web design companies - watching the Haystack.com launch gave me a couple new ideas.</p>

<p>Primarily, it&#8217;s made me wonder if I have the right breakdown between free and paid tutors accounts on my site.  Currently, I let tutors get the first 3 job requests free, then ask them to upgrade for $10/month.  This worked much <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-evolution-of-a-business-model-never-stop-testing/">better</a> than a 30 day free trial but still has a problem: tutors who don&#8217;t want to pay at that point get kicked off the site!</p>

<p>Currently there are about 7,000 tutors with live profiles on the site.  But there are an additional 5,000 tutors who USED to have a profile on the site but they decided not to pay after 3 job requests and got booted off the site.  That means I&#8217;d have almost twice as many listings if those tutors hadn&#8217;t been kicked off (or more accurately, the number of listings would be growing twice as fast over time).  It&#8217;s also probably hurts the number of <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com/tutoring_jobs">tutor signups</a> you get in the first place if people know there is a ticking time bomb on their account (3 jobs left, 2 jobs left, 1 job left&#8230;boom!  pay up or your account is gone).</p>

<p>So what is the solution?  This made me wonder if there are different benefits I could provide for the paid tutor account that didn&#8217;t involve a deadline.  How about&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Get listed first in search results (yes, maybe)</p></li>
<li><p>List more pictures (no, doesn&#8217;t work here)</p></li>
<li><p>Bigger profile (no, probably not as important here - photos don&#8217;t matter as much in tutoring)</p></li>
<li><p>Offer more storage, or bandwidth on the site (no, doesn&#8217;t work in this case)</p></li>
<li><p>Make the job requests limited some other way, like max 1 per month, but you can do that forever with the free account  (maybe&#8230;)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m not sure, what do you think?  Getting listed first in search results sounds like a good one, and I might add that anyway (even if I keep the same business model).  But I&#8217;m not sure if that alone would be enough to convince people to upgrade.</p>

<p>Making a limited number of job requests per month (every month, with no deadline) is an interesting one.  This works well for sites like FaxZero.com, where you can only send a limited number of faxes with the free account but you can do so forever without upgrading.  So a &#8220;light&#8221; user gets hooked on it for free, but if they need to start sending more faxes it&#8217;s a natural upgrade.  But would this work for tutoring?  There is a relatively high turnover in tutoring, so you need to keep getting new students, but it&#8217;s not like faxes.  Getting just a couple good regular students could be all you need for a while.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think?  Have I struck the right balance with UniversityTutor&#8217;s business model or is there a way to offer a free account without a deadline and curb the number of tutors getting booted off the site?</strong></p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free,

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve noticed a trend of sites coming out recently that are built around the idea of taking short, funny, user generated content.  Often users can submit them as text messages or emails.  Sort of like Twitter but on a particular topic.</p>

<p>It might sound stupid, but some of these sites are getting over <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/fmylife.com+textsfromlastnight.com/">1 million unique visitors</a> a month, and probably doing about $1 million a year in advertising revenue from it.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://www.fmylife.com">fmylife.com</a> let&#8217;s people submit funny one liners about how much their life sucks.  Users rate them or bury them based on how funny they are.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-71.png" alt="Picture 7" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.textsfromlastnight.com/">TextsFromLastNight.com</a> does something similar with funny text messages you probably shouldn&#8217;t have sent when you were drunk.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-8.png" alt="Picture 8" /></p>

<p>Juvenile?  Worthless?  Maybe, but they are also pulling an insane amount of traffic and dollars from these sites.</p>

<p>Two people I&#8217;ve talked to recently are starting similar sites.</p>

<p>The first is <a href="http://www.TextsFromTheGame.com">TextsFromTheGame.com</a>, a similar idea based around sports and all the trash talking that guys love to do.  These guys are just getting started so if you&#8217;re a sports fan please help them out and go submit the best trash talk you&#8217;ve heard recently.  Also add &#8220;text at textsfromthegame.com&#8221; to your phone so you can easily forward them good ones you hear in the moment.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget these after the fact, so the idea is that when someone says something really funny you can shout out &#8220;that&#8217;s going on textsfromthegame!&#8221; and forward it right there from your phone.</p>

<p>The other one is still being developed but it will be <a href="http://www.exfiles.com">exfiles.com</a> (a great domain) and will feature short quips about, you guessed it, your crazy ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend.  Follow them on <a href="http://twitter.com/exfiles/">twitter</a> or add your email to their website to get notified when it launches.</p>

<p>I have to say, these don&#8217;t strike me &#8220;change the world&#8221; type of projects or see them as helping a ton of people.  But who knows, maybe making people laugh is all the value you need.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think?  Passing fad, or new way to build a big site with user-generated content?</strong></p>
