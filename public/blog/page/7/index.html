  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had an interesting conversation with <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/">Neil Patel</a> earlier this week.  I called him to get some advice on <a href="http://www.UniversityTutor.com">UniversityTutor.com</a> and how I could take it to the next level.  Neil is a really successful guy in the web business space, so I figured it&#8217;d be a good brainstorm.</p>

<p>His biggest advice was to get more incoming links to the site.  This is probably the most important thing you can do to rank well in search engines, because Google (and others) place a high value on how many sites link to you.  It&#8217;s also a great barrier to entry against competitors because an established site will have lots of incoming links built up over time and it will be very difficult for a new startup to outrank them in search engines.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m already ranking well for some local searches (such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=biology+tutor+austin&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">biology tutor austin</a>)  but not so well in other (such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=YBf&amp;q=find+a+tutor&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g-s10">find a tutor</a>).  This is largely due to how long those sites have been around and how many incoming links they have.</p>

<p>So obviously getting more links is good, but HOW was the big question.  Neil&#8217;s advice was to follow the same model <a href="http://www.Yelp.com">Yelp.com</a> used with their <a href="http://www.yelp.com/bling">user badges</a>.  This lets Yelp users display their reviews on their own blog or website.  They get to show off their work, and Yelp get&#8217;s an incoming link.  You just have to provide users with a little snippet of code and an incentive to paste it into their site.</p>

<p>So a day later I had launched tutor &#8220;bling&#8221; that my tutors can add to their own websites (blogs, school websites, facebook profiles, etc).  Since a lot of the tutors are university students, it would be particularly great if I got some incoming .edu links (these carry a particularly high value) but we&#8217;ll have to see on that.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-4.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-4.png" alt="Tutor Bling" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-5.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-5.png" alt="Picture 5" /></a></p>

<p>As an added incentive I built in my <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com/about/affiliate">UniversityTutor affiliate program</a> so all the pre-generated links contain a tutor&#8217;s affiliate code (they can track it using the stats at the bottom).  Using this they can not only advertise their profile, but also get paid for any new tutors they refer.</p>

<p><strong>One More Idea&#8230;.</strong></p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t related to my conversation with Neil, but I thought about it after reading a story on Hotmail.com.  Hotmail got popular FAST (something like 2 million users in 18 months) almost entirely because they forced you to include a line in the bottom of every email that said &#8220;Get A Free Email Account At Hotmail.com&#8221;, or something to that effect.</p>

<p>There are over 100 contact messages going through UniversityTutor.com every day now, so I decided to add a line to the bottom of their contact emails reminding them of the opportunity to refer new tutors and get paid for it.  You can see the new line in the email below.  This is more for word of mouth than SEO because I don&#8217;t think Google will index links from someone&#8217;s Facebook profile.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-13.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-13.png" alt="Referral Email" /></a></p>

<p>So what do you think, will it work?  Here is a graph of search engine traffic to UniversityTutor.com over the last three months (traffic from search engines makes up about 50% of total traffic).</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-6.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-6.png" alt="Search Engine Traffic" /></a></p>

<p>It will probably take a month or two to have any effect (if it works), but we&#8217;ll see!</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is going to be a random collection of thoughts/events from the past week.</p>

<p><strong>Video of Mint.com Founder</strong></p>

<p>You might have heard recently that personal finance site Mint.com got acquired by Intuit for $170 million.  This video by the founder, Aaron Patzer, is really awesome and should be watched by all entrepreneurs I think.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRfV0YfvDP4">Click Here For The Video</a></p>

<p>Some highlights&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Each technical founder adds $500k to your valuation, each MBA founder subtracts $250k from your valuation</p></li>
<li><p>He discusses how keeping costs low saved his company (personally I think they can be even lower), a common theme on this blog</p></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/"><strong>Answers.OnStartups.com</strong></a></p>

<p>This is a brilliant site that just came out which does questions and answers for entrepreneurs.  It is based on the software behind StackOverflow.com, a popular question and answer site for programmers which has seen <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/stackoverflow.com/">meteoric growth</a> over the last year.</p>

<p>Traditionally there have been 3 main types of community websites: forums, wikis, and blogs.  This format is different.  It combines elements of all three while adding some new features.  I think it is far and away the best format for a Q&amp;A site.</p>

<p>After seeing this format take off with StackOverflow.com, I incorporated pieces of it into the BuyersVote.com design, such as the voting and reputation.  I think we&#8217;ll see more Q&amp;A sites like this come out soon, so this is probably a good opportunity for entrepreneurs to start their own niche Q&amp;A site (accounting and taxes anyone?).  I&#8217;ve put in a <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/945/how-did-dharmesh-get-the-source-code-is-it-open-source-now">request</a> to get more info on obtaining the source code for free if you want to start your own Q&amp;A site like this.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think this will turn into an amazing resource for entrepreneurs.  <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/">Check out the site</a> and start participating.</p>

<p><strong>UniversityTutor.com Update</strong></p>

<p>Finally, I&#8217;ve been making some interesting changes on UniversityTutor.com.  I&#8217;ve built some massive campaigns in both Google Adwords and Microsoft Bing lately to drive new traffic to the site.  They are converting (in other words each dollar spent on ads is bringing in more than one dollar in revenue) and the site is seeing some good growth right now.</p>

<p>In addition, I was playing around the other day and typed &#8220;tutoring jobs&#8221; into Google.  My site ranked on the 5th page of google results.  If you aren&#8217;t on the first page of results you are basically non-existent for that keyword.  Nobody clicks through to the 2nd or 3rd page.</p>

<p>I decided to try targeting the &#8220;tutoring jobs&#8221; keyword so I can improve my ranking in Google.  I setup this page for <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com/tutoring_jobs">tutoring jobs</a> which you can see is optimized for it.  There is a trade off here when you target a page to search engines instead of human beings.  The text I had on the page before was &#8220;Tutor Signup&#8221; with a different heading about signing up for a free account.  This was probably a little more clear to human beings than the simple &#8220;tutoring jobs&#8221; title I have there now.  But it will rank better in search engines.  So it&#8217;s a trade off.  I&#8217;ll have to see how it works out.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes I post up <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-generate-word-of-mouth-for-your-business/">reviews</a> of books I&#8217;ve enjoyed.</p>

<p>But I think it&#8217;d be interesting to get a collective approach from all the readers of this blog.  What books on business have had the greatest impact on you?  Which book do you find yourself recommending to other entrepreneurs the most?</p>

<p>A bunch of suggestions have already been added to BuyersVote.com.  What would you add or subtract?  You can <a href="http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-books-for-entrepreneurs-reviews">check out the list here</a> to add your two cents.</p>

<p><a href="http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-books-for-entrepreneurs-reviews"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-2.png" alt="Picture 2" /></a></p>

<p>In case you&#8217;ve never used BuyersVote.com before, here is a quick review of how it works (it&#8217;s really simple):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you like an item, vote it up (+1)</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#8217;t like an item, vote it down (-1)</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a better idea, add it at the bottom</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You&#8217;ll have to <a href="http://buyersvote.com/user_session/new">login</a> to vote (sorry, that is the only way I could find to keep voting fair), but you can use your Google account or one you already have so there is no registration process.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t really related, but another category that I put together recently on BuyersVote is for the <a href="http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-halloween-costume-ideas-2009-reviews">best halloween costume ideas of 2009</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-halloween-costume-ideas-2009-reviews"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/10/Picture-12.png" alt="Best Halloween Costume Ideas 2009" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see, some of them are good, some are bad (maybe even offensive).  But this is the beauty of crowd sourced data.  Good ideas get pushed to the top and bad ideas get pushed down (with enough participants).</p>

<p>I actually have an ulterior motive for this category: I&#8217;m hoping to get on the first page of Google for keywords related to Halloween costume ideas this season!  There will obviously be quite a bit of traffic over the next month for those keywords and, if it works, some new people will be introduced to BuyersVote that wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise seen it.  This is a nice little marketing technique that you might want to try: target a highly specific seasonal keyword.  If you can get on the first page of Google for it, you might be able to ride a nice wave of traffic that few other people are competing for.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s inspiring to check out your Google Analytics stats sometimes.  Things go up and down naturally a bit each month, but as long as you&#8217;re helping more people over time then it will be hard not to be successful.</p>

<p>According to Google, over 33,000 people used something that I built last month.  That&#8217;s a drop in the bucket compared to many sites online but for me it still feels pretty good.  It&#8217;s way more than I could have talked to in person, for example.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/Picture-9.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/Picture-9.png" alt="Google Analytics Screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>Remember, the only way to build wealth is to help other people.  If you want to earn more you have to either:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>provide something of greater value</p></li>
<li><p>provide it to more people</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Most people focus on #1 - for example, a doctor earns more than a barber.  When you need a heart transplant you really need it, whereas a haircut can wait.  There is almost no upper limit on the amount you&#8217;d be willing to pay to get a heart transplant done right (after all, what use is your money if you aren&#8217;t around to spend it).  But a botched haircut isn&#8217;t going to hurt much other than your social life for a few weeks.  The principle of scarcity is also at work here.  There are plenty of people qualified to cut hair but fewer who are qualified to perform heart surgery.  You could say there is a higher barrier to entry into that market (medical school, intelligence, etc).  So clearly, one way to earn more is to provide something of great value that people can&#8217;t get anywhere else.</p>

<p>But I think it&#8217;s a mistake to focus only on #1.  You miss out on scale.  Even if what you&#8217;re providing is 100 times more valuable, you&#8217;re limited in that you can only help a fixed number of people in a day (indeed, a doctor and a barber see about the same number of people in a day).  Technology is the key that allows you to scale.  It allows you to help not hundreds, but thousands or millions of times more people.  Now we&#8217;re not talking doctor rich, we&#8217;re talking Bill Gates rich.  Technology lets you <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-secret-to-working-less-producing-more-and-getting-rich/">build a water wheel</a> instead of carrying buckets.</p>

<p>Even if you are helping each individual person less, scale makes up for it.  Each of the 33,000 people who came to my websites in the last month probably only got a little bit of help (nothing like the value of a heart transplant).  But if next month 50,000 people used it or 50 million, it wouldn&#8217;t take much more of my time and I would have drastically increased the amount of value I contributed to the world.  In other words, it scales.</p>

<p>There have been lots of technologies over the years that let people scale, and some of them still work.  Writing a book scales (you don&#8217;t have to sit and tell it to each person, they can read it on their own).  Having a television program scales (whether 10 or 10 million people watch it doesn&#8217;t change what you do).  But I think technology in the modern sense (specifically software and the internet) is perhaps the best one around today to get rich.  It&#8217;s probably the one with the biggest untapped potential because it&#8217;s the newest and still evolving.</p>

<p>So see if you can build something that helps people AND is scalable.  It&#8217;s definitely more work up front to do that.  In the beginning maybe nobody will use it and you could have earned more giving haircuts.  But in the long run if you keep growing the number of people you help each month, then people will find a way to compensate you for it (whether it&#8217;s flat out paying you, or clicking some ads, or whatever).  If there&#8217;s no limit on the number of people you can help then there&#8217;s no limit on how much you can earn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Copywriting is hard.</p>

<p>Sometimes I find it easy to explain things clearly and succinctly.  But other times I really struggle to capture the main idea of a complex subject in just a few lines.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s so deceptive about good writing is that it looks simple when you read it.  It looks casual, like someone jotted it down in just a few seconds and it&#8217;s so easy to understand.  But if you&#8217;ve spent any time writing you know how wrong that assumption is: it actually takes much longer to write something in fewer words.</p>

<p>Case in point, here is a piece of copy I revised on <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com">UniversityTutor.com</a> today.</p>

<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/Picture-7.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/Picture-7.png" alt="Picture 7" /></a></p>

<p><strong>After:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/Picture-8.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/Picture-8.png" alt="Picture 8" /></a></p>

<p>Aside from the blatant grammar mistake in the first one (&#8220;we&#8217;ll won&#8217;t&#8221;) which somehow went unnoticed, here are some other improvements I thought about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I gave up trying to combine both ideas (contacts are free AND we don&#8217;t take a percent) in one section.  The free contacts was an important point but it was already elsewhere on the page so I decided to just focus on one thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Throwing out unnecessary parts can be just as valuable as adding the right parts.  Anything which isn&#8217;t relevant pulls attention away from what is.</p></li>
<li><p>People in marketing talk a lot about features vs. benefits.  Getting free contacts is more of a feature.  People don&#8217;t lay awake at night worrying about how to get free contacts on my website.  They worry about saving money.  You have to get to the root of the benefit you are providing and not get caught up in listing features.</p></li>
<li><p>Shorter is better.  Three lines of text is worth reading whereas four (spilling over to the fifth) is approaching a paragraph and people don&#8217;t read paragraphs (at least in marketing copy).</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s more dramatic and drives the point home to say &#8220;they take 50%&#8221; than it is to say &#8220;we don&#8217;t take a percentage&#8221;.  Subtle wording changes can make a big difference.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m certainly no copywriting expert but I find it interesting to practice.  It&#8217;s an art form that all entrepreneurs should at least basically understand.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read a number of books over the years on it but the one that stands out is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593374992?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1593374992">The Ultimate Sales Letter</a>, by Dan Kennedy.  It was pretty good if you want to just get the basics down in one book.</p>

<p>However, I think like anything you can go too far down this road.  Most internet marketers take it too far where they create these ridiculous landing pages and testimonial things all over the internet that cause them to lose a lot of credibility.  If you focus too much on marketing you end up getting to a point where you are just trying to trick ignorant people, instead of doing the most important thing: building a product that is actually useful.</p>

<p>Having a useful product can make up for all the bad marketing in the world, or no marketing at all, because people will do it all for you by word of mouth and you&#8217;ll be richer in the long run.  But there&#8217;s no reason to make it harder on yourself and rely on that.  You&#8217;d do better to make a great product and also understand the basics of good marketing and copywriting.  After all, you&#8217;ve often only got a second or two (literally) before people click the back button on their browser.  You&#8217;ve got to make that first impression fast or you might not get another chance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a week ago I met up with another entrepreneur here in Buenos Aires named Eric Northam (he is running a cool software-as-a-service business down here called <a href="http://EasyBroker.com">EasyBroker.com</a> - check it out if you get a chance).</p>

<p>He loaned me a book to read while I was down here, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1427798613?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1427798613">Word Of Mouth Marketing</a>, since I&#8217;m a little bit short on English reading material.  The book turned out to generate some good ideas.  Below are my notes while reading it.  At the end I posted some ideas it generated for my business.  Maybe it will help you out too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1427798613?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1427798613"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/Picture-5.png" alt="Picture 5" /></a></p>

<p><strong>My notes&#8230;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>90% of WOM marketing happens offline, people mentioning you in passing to friends and colleagues.  We focus on the 10% that happens online because it&#8217;s easier to measure and track, but remember it&#8217;s only 10%.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s easy to lose track of how important WOM marketing is.  We think of lead generation in terms of things we pay for (like Adwords) but since WOM is free we often don&#8217;t realize how many of our new customers came from it.</p></li>
<li><p>give a weird perk to customers, ex. <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-most-awesome-car-wash-of-all-time/">water guns at the car wash</a>, free drinks at the barbershop, enterprise car rental offers to pick you up.  People will talk about it and remember it, it sticks in their head.</p></li>
<li><p>WOM works against you if you suck</p></li>
<li><p>no ad will convince someone if they have heard through WOM that you suck</p></li>
<li><p>be known for something, like the 7 inch high corned beef sandwich in new york - nobody actually needs a 7 inch sandwich, but it&#8217;s memorable so it gets repeated to tourists who are looking for something to do</p></li>
<li><p>stop buying ads, thrill your customers and they&#8217;ll advertise for you</p></li>
<li><p>be funny, White Castle let people reserve tables for Valentines Day</p></li>
<li><p>give people metrics to show off to their friends</p></li>
<li><p>you can screw up WOM by offering to pay people for it, when the person gets to your website and finds out their friend got paid for it, the recommendation feels less sincere</p></li>
<li><p>search engines only pull one link from the New York Times, but they pull hundreds from blogs, individuals now have the power to talk about you and get noticed, individuals (as a whole) are more important than major media now</p></li>
<li><p>search engines are going to be death to bad companies (side note: why hasn&#8217;t this happened already? tons of bad companies still exist - reviews are still too spread out all over the internet in blog comments and forum posts - they don&#8217;t have the impact they should, this is one thing I wanted to fix with <a href="http://buyersvote.com">BuyersVote.com</a>, consolidating reviews into one simple number)</p></li>
<li><p>marketing is what you DO now, not what you say will do.  people will report on what really happened</p></li>
<li><p>if the first couple reviews for a new product on Amazon are negative, it can kill the entire product</p></li>
<li><p>cheap call centers, giving unpaid bills to collection agencies - these steps which companies take to be more profitable are actually going to start hurting them as word of mouth gets recorded online - everyone is a watchdog now, reporting on your actions</p></li>
<li><p>happy customers are the best advertising (cheaper and more effective than Google Adsense)</p></li>
<li><p>advertising is the tax you pay for having an unremarkable product</p></li>
<li><p>negative WOM is an opportunity for you to fix something and show you care</p></li>
<li><p>put a &#8220;Tell A Friend&#8221; link on every page of your website</p></li>
<li><p>give free food (a weird one) when customers are waiting in line</p></li>
<li><p>remarkable packaging helps start conversations as people carry it around town, make people ask them &#8220;what did you just buy?&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>your best WOM customer could be your newest customer, not the one who has been around a while</p></li>
<li><p>every time someone emails you with a problem it&#8217;s an opportunity.  Go out of your way to do AWESOME customer support and they&#8217;ll tell a few people.  The bar is set pretty low since people are used to terrible call centers.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to become known for something.  Something that is short and simple that people can repeat in casual conversation.  Like &#8220;Enterprise, they&#8217;ll pick you up&#8221; or &#8220;go to Joe&#8217;s sandwhich shop, they&#8217;ve got the biggest meatball sub in New York&#8221; or &#8220;Have you tried Pandora?  It builds a radio station just for you&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>Try filling in the blanks about your business: You should really try <strong><strong><strong><em>, it&#8217;s </em></strong></strong></strong>__.</p></li>
<li><p>There should not be an &#8216;and&#8217; in the blank.  Lists don&#8217;t work&#8230;it&#8217;s friendly, affordable, and fun.  It has to be one simple thing, like &#8220;they give you free ice cream while you wait&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t underestimate the power of doing something silly.  Duct Tape brand has a contest where high schools students make prom dresses and tuxedos out of duct tape.  People talk about it.  Pictures get forwarded around the internet and to relatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Progressive insurance gives you the prices of competitors, even if they&#8217;re lower.  Risky right?  Well, no&#8230;customers were probably looking at competitors prices anyway, but it&#8217;s remarkable they do it so they get word of mouth.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t be so professional and show some personality, like Google&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling lucky&#8221; button.  Or Facebook let&#8217;s you change your language to talk like a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/19/once-again-facebook-owns-talk-like-a-pirate-day-on-the-web/">pirate</a>.  Be weird.</p></li>
<li><p>Give people a free postcard at your hotel (with your Hotel&#8217;s name on it).  They needed to send one to their relatives anyway and will happily use yours.</p></li>
<li><p>On your &#8220;tell a friend&#8221; form, make sure it allows for multiple recipients.  Also make sure the message comes from the referrer, not your website.  They don&#8217;t know who you are, but they&#8217;ll open a message from their friend.</p></li>
<li><p>YouTube got popular (at least in part) because on every single page they ask people to &#8220;Share This Video&#8221; and embed it in their own website.</p></li>
<li><p>Hotmail went from 0 to 8 million users in less than two years.  How?  They included a short line at the end of every email &#8220;Get Your Free Email From Hotmail&#8221;.  Possibly the most pure WOM product of all time.</p></li>
<li><p>Skype spread by WOM because if you wanted the call to be free, the other person had to install Skype too.  Same thing with Fax machines.</p></li>
<li><p>If you ship products, put something unusual in every box you ship.  Like a bag of M&amp;Ms, or a coupon people will hand out.  Or a note asking if they&#8217;ll leave you a review on Amazon.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#8217;re going to give away swag (free t-shirts, cups, etc).  Make them cool and stuff that people will actually use.  Can&#8217;t tell you how many free t-shirts I&#8217;ve seen that are extra large and I will never wear.</p></li>
<li><p>You should have a blog (duh).  It takes time to build it up, but it&#8217;s an essential tool today.  It is the modern day resume.  If people can&#8217;t find what you&#8217;ve done or what you are doing in your career online, it seems less important.  Choose your name as the domain name, if you are doing anything important people are going to Google you.</p></li>
<li><p>Include &#8220;easter eggs&#8221; in your products.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Some Ideas It Generated For My Businesses</strong></p>

<p>So as I was reading, I would take a few minutes to think about how each idea applied to my various web businesses.</p>

<p>BuyersVote.com is a naturally viral product because it ranks things.  Whenever you claim something or someone is better or worse, it generates controversy and gets people&#8217;s attention.  So I came up with some ideas to help multiply this effect.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make an &#8220;awards&#8221; page with the highest and lowest rated items across the entire site.  You could also do best and worst this year, and month also.  This could definitely generate some WOM if people could say &#8220;did you see XYZ was the worst rated company of all time?&#8221; or &#8220;We had the top rated product on BuyersVote this month!&#8221;  If you loved the company you&#8217;d go there to defend it.  If you hated the company you&#8217;d go there to throw gas on the fire.</p></li>
<li><p>Make some badges, little images, that people could display on their site.  They could say thing &#8220;top rated cell phone of 2009 on BuyersVote.com&#8221; or something like that.</p></li>
<li><p>Make some swag at CafePress.com like maybe a t-shirt that said &#8220;Careful, I&#8217;ll be rating your performance on BuyersVote.com&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>Let people Tweet their reviews out!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This last one was quite simple to do, so I actually threw it together and it&#8217;s now live on the site.  People can tweet their reviews!  When you&#8217;re signed in a little link like this will appear:</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/Picture-31.png" alt="Picture-3" /></p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/Picture-4.png" alt="Picture 4" /></p>

<p>For UniversityTutor.com I was thinking about swag I could send to tutors&#8230;t-shirts, coffee cups, etc.  But none of these sounded very exciting.  Then I had an interesting idea: what about business cards?</p>

<p>I have a feeling tutors would actually use these because business cards are new and cool for college students (you probably haven&#8217;t gotten them before) and if you had them in your dorm room, your friends would probably ask you about them.  I wouldn&#8217;t be able to send them to all tutors obviously, but for paying tutors perhaps it would be a worthwhile investment.  How much could it cost to send 250 business cards to a paying tutor?  Maybe less than $10, which is what they pay in their first month.  So it would break even quickly and help generate WOM.  I&#8217;d have to investigate this further and see what companies out there could make this process really easy.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The book was quite simple and an easy read.  It didn&#8217;t tell me anything earth shattering that I didn&#8217;t already know, but at the same time it was very helpful in generating some ideas while I was reading it.  If you&#8217;d like to check out the book on Amazon you can see it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1427798613?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1427798613">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts in the comments about WOM.  Which of these techniques do you think has the most potential?  Which have had the greatest effect in your business?</p>

<p>Finally, just for fun here is a picture of my &#8220;office&#8221; in Buenos Aires where I spend an average work day.  Pretty tough life, right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been in sort of a holding pattern the last few weeks since I&#8217;m between projects and the ones I have are all running on auto-pilot.  For the most part I am well rested with nothing especially urgent to do and this has given me some great time to think.</p>

<p>Some people call this taking time to &#8220;sharpen the saw&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been talking and meeting with other entrepreneurs, doing lots of reading, finding new sources of inspiration, and today I did some brainstorming.</p>

<p>This is one of the real benefits of not having a job: you can take time in the middle of the day to be creative, think about the future, and develop your long term goals and skills.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/2403249501_a57876dcb8.jpg" alt="Thinking" />
Image <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/somemixedstuff/2403249501/">source</a></p>

<p>By the way, brainstorming seems to work better with a blank sheet of paper and a pen.  There is something about doing this by hand which is important.  It separates you from the computer and distractions, and there is something about moving your hand that makes you more creative.  And it&#8217;s harder to focus if you try this while driving through traffic or something.  Writing it really helps.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some interesting questions I came up with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>What&#8217;s going to be the next thing to go online?</strong>
The internet has disrupted so many old businesses, it&#8217;s safe to assume this trend will continue.  Dating went online, along with music, project management, plane tickets, telephone calls, television, and movies.  Sure these things take time, but from an entrepreneurial point of view, internet has already killed television.  It&#8217;s too late to jump on that ship.  I wish I had invented Skype, but someone else already did it.  So what is going to be the next thing to move online?  Maybe it will be buying real estate (the whole transaction from start to finish), sending physical objects to each other by email attachment (imagine hitting print and getting a 3D object like a toaster out somehow), running scientific experiments through the internet (test tubes in the cloud?), or - and I hesitate to mention this - people having virtual sex through the internet with some kind of robots?  Who knows&#8230;all of those could happen in our lifetime, and somebody is going to make a killing off it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What technology do I want to make obsolete?  What&#8217;s inefficient?</strong>
This is another way to look at it.  What is old and broken.  Why isn&#8217;t there a startup doing health insurance that would cover you for life?  Man&#8230;I would sign up for that, if I knew they could never drop me for a pre-existing condition or too many illnesses.  That would be a great feature to attract new business.  Sure, they could probably only take young people right now to be profitable over time (and wouldn&#8217;t be a solution for people who currently can&#8217;t get coverage), but it could be great in the long term.  The real estate buying process is still light years behind the rest of the world, why hasn&#8217;t anyone fixed that?  What about the DMV, and doing your taxes.  Sadly, it is no coincidence that when you start thinking about inefficient businesses they seem to be all be affected by government in some way.  This makes them less attractive to entrepreneurs, and I don&#8217;t blame them, but there is still some opportunity there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are people currently paying for that I can make free somehow?</strong>
I call this the &#8220;PlentyOfFish&#8221; model.  Basically, they took a product that everyone was paying for (online dating) and made a free, ad-supported, alternative.  Ad-supported is sort of a bad word these days, but it could still work.  What&#8217;s too expensive?  Paypal, internet access, international calls&#8230;not sure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is life going to be like 10 years from now in 2019?</strong>
It&#8217;s so easy to get caught up in thinking  &#8220;shoot! if I had only thought of Amazon.com (or Twitter, Google, Basecamp, etc.)  in 1999 I could have beat them!&#8221;  But that&#8217;s not productive because back in 1999 those guys were sitting around NOT thinking about what they could have done in 1989, they were thinking about what the world was going to be like in 2009 and then they got to work on making it happen.  So the question we need to be asking today is what the world is going to be like in 2019, and what businesses is that world going to make possible that aren&#8217;t possible today?  I don&#8217;t know about you but I envision every movie we see being in 3D, there being dirt cheap projectors and flat screens showing up everywhere (kind of like minority report where the walls of our house are built out of these things and they&#8217;re on cereal boxes, etc).  Everyone will probably be zipping around in electric vehicles.  I hope they do something with airlines too, where they are much faster and easier to board and you can get anywhere in the world in a few hours.  There will probably be a lot more robots too that we start interacting with.  What kind of businesses will this enable?  Probably lots, but I for one would like to see some innovative art come out of this.  Why not have new (digital) paintings on our walls every day that we can give a thumbs up or thumbs down to so it learns our preferences over time.  Maybe we can make some of those painting like in the Harry Potter movies where the portraits of people move and their eyes follow you.  Maybe we can digitize people&#8217;s brains and keep their memories on flash drives, or even run their brains in a human simulator on our computers so can still ask them questions after they pass away.  Creepy, but probably useful somehow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How can I empower people to get all the basic stuff they need in life?</strong>
Charity is cool too, but I&#8217;m more for enabling people to help themselves (the fishing pole, not the fish).  What can you do that would make people richer?  This is where I started thinking about how to eliminate taxes, but I&#8217;ll save that for another post, haha.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The next Google is hidden in exercises like this; one of us need to implement it.  I&#8217;m curious to hear your take on these questions as well in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Breaking Free, the <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">book</a>, came out a few years ago when this blog started.  Since then it has done reasonably well (for a first time author) both in print and online.  But something happened a while after it came out: I started to wish I&#8217;d given the electronic version away for free and only charged for the print copies.</p>

<p>After all, there were a number of online free eBooks that had come out that I&#8217;d really enjoyed and had been successful, like <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>, the <a href="http://charliehoehn.com/2009/07/14/announcing-my-first-e-book/">Recession Proof Grad</a>, and a number of <a href="http://superaff.com/archives/2006/02/15/the-master-list-of-seth-godins-free-ebooks/">Seth Godin&#8217;s</a> works.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/bookImage.jpg" alt="Breaking Free Brian Armstrong" /></a>To many people it might seem counter-intuitive to release a book for free, but things are changing in the digital age.  Much electronic content can be shared online at zero cost, and the distribution cost of an eBook has come down to zero.  So some authors find it useful as a means to build their brand, spread an idea, etc - things which can be much more valuable than book sales.  And in many cases (Getting Real being one example) it turned out they sold MORE paper copies as a result of releasing the eBook for free.  People liked what they read online and wanted a &#8220;dead tree&#8221; version to read the rest more easily, mark up with notes, share with a friend as a gift, or just say thank you.</p>

<p>Of course, the biggest problem this presented in my case is that I&#8217;d already been selling the eBook version for some time, and people would be upset if I decided to release it now for free.  So I pondered this for a while and came up with a solution that isn&#8217;t perfect but I hope will be a valid compromise: if you purchased an electronic copy in the past and would like a refund now that it&#8217;s free, simply <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/contact/">contact me</a> and I&#8217;ll send it right over with my sincere apologies.  It&#8217;s been out for two years now and sales have started to slow, so I figured if I was going to do it the time was now.  I also decided it should be done in a totally open and transparent way with a blog post.  To be honest, my hope is that most people who bought it found it worth purchasing a year or two ahead of other people (the emails I get tend to indicate that is the case) but if not I am more than happy to eat the cost for my mistake in not making it free from the beginning.  This was a really hard decision to make actually, and I wish I&#8217;d gotten it right from the beginning so this wasn&#8217;t necessary.  But I didn&#8217;t, so hopefully this will make the best of an unfortunate situation.</p>

<p>On the plus side, this will hopefully make the ideas in the book available to a much wider audience and build readership to the blog over time.  I&#8217;ve updated the book&#8217;s <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">page on this blog</a>.  And if you haven&#8217;t already, please feel free to check it out.</p>

<p>And if you&#8217;re upset by this as someone who purchased it in the past, I totally understand.  Feel free to <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/contact/">contact me</a> for a refund and I&#8217;ll make it right.<a href="../contact/">
</a></p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently stumbled on the writings of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> and I have to say I&#8217;ve been incredibly impressed.  It&#8217;s not often that I find myself finding such insight and experience in what I read.  Most people out there are hawking versions of the same story, but Paul Graham seems to have a unique perspective on quite a lot of issues, and he has the experience to back it up.</p>

<p>He covers topics that are right in line for readers of this blog, such as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html">How To Build Wealth</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html">How To Do A Startup</a>, and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">How To Love Your Work</a>.</p>

<p>His articles can be quite long (many of them have been compiled into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596006624">book</a> actually).  But I&#8217;ve included some highlighted passages below that stood out to me as I was reading.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/paulgraham_2070_13211740.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/09/paulgraham_2070_13211740.jpg" alt="paulgraham_2070_13211740" /></a></p>

<p>He is a programmer as well so I was able to relate on a lot of those points.  He built a software company in the 90&#8217;s which eventually was sold to Yahoo for around $50 million and became the Yahoo Stores product.  He is now a venture capitalist and started y-Combinator, something I <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/y-combinator-demo-day/">wrote</a> about in the past and was very impressed with (but didn&#8217;t know he was connected to at the time).  I&#8217;m surprised I hadn&#8217;t heard of him until now.  His <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">essays</a> are outstanding (he doesn&#8217;t really have a blog but there is an RSS feed for his essays which you can subscribe to).</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html">wealth</a>&#8230;</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world&#8230;When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie. &#8220;You can&#8217;t make the pie larger,&#8221; say politicians.  Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is&#8211; and you specifically are&#8211; one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you&#8217;ll get more for it.  In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven&#8217;t made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie.</p>

<p>If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. That&#8217;s been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully, run upstairs. (Here he is talking about the idea of going after hard problems in business, and how small companies can solve them quicker).</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>On <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html">how to do a startup</a>&#8230;</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Do the founders of a startup have to include business people? That depends. We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called &#8220;business&#8221; if they would be the president. But they all said no, so I had to do it myself. And what I discovered was that business was no great mystery. It&#8217;s not something like physics or medicine that requires extensive study. You just try to get people to pay you for stuff.</p>

<p>&#8230;you can recognize genuinely smart people by their ability to say things like &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; and &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand x well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each person with an MBA, you&#8217;ll learn something important about business school. You don&#8217;t even hit an MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike. There are only four MBAs in the top 50. What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with technical backgrounds. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you&#8217;d do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use. Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people. Stephen Hawking&#8217;s editor told him that every equation he included in his book would cut sales in half. When you work on making technology easier to use, you&#8217;re riding that curve up instead of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn&#8217;t just increase your sales 10%. It&#8217;s more likely to double your sales.</p>

<p>If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with computers. Most good hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.</p>

<p>Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it&#8217;s easier to sell to them. It&#8217;s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a lot of time and money to do it. And while you can outhack Oracle with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can&#8217;t outsell an Oracle salesman. So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers.</p>

<p>Google understands a few other things most Web companies still don&#8217;t. The most important is that you should put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren&#8217;t. One of my favorite bumper stickers reads &#8220;if the people lead, the leaders will follow.&#8221; Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes &#8220;get all the users, and the advertisers will follow.&#8221; More generally, design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money from it. If you don&#8217;t put users first, you leave a gap for competitors who do.</p>

<p>For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm. Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive. For us the test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron chairs. The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular with startups. Especially the type, all too common then, that was like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs. We had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off. This was slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right without knowing it.</p>

<p>The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do. To start with, people are a recurring expense, which is the worst kind. They also tend to cause you to grow out of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office building that will make your software worse. But worst of all, they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone&#8217;s office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to have a meeting about it. So the fewer people you can hire, the better.</p>

<p>If two companies have the same revenues, it&#8217;s the one with fewer employees that&#8217;s more impressive. When people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered &#8220;twenty,&#8221; I could see them thinking that we didn&#8217;t count for much. I used to want to add &#8220;but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger of the two numbers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest company of all, the government. Yes, there are lots of opportunities to sell them technology. But let someone else start those startups.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>On reaching &#8221;<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html">ramen profitability</a>&#8220;&#8230;</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders&#8217; living expenses&#8230;.A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup, because the moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard. Startups are still very rare. Why don&#8217;t more people do it? The financial risk? Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway. The long hours? Plenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs. What keeps people from starting startups is the fear of having so much responsibility. And this is not an irrational fear: it really is hard to bear. Anything that takes some of that weight off you will greatly increase your chances of surviving.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>On finding <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">work that you love</a>&#8230;</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it. I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous. It was like being told to use dry water. Whatever I thought he meant, I didn&#8217;t think he meant work could literally be fun—fun like playing. It took me years to grasp that.</p>

<p>What you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends&#8230;This is easy advice to give. It&#8217;s hard to follow, especially when you&#8217;re young. Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you&#8217;d like to like.</p>

<p>The other big force leading people astray is money. Money by itself is not that dangerous. When something pays well but is regarded with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal injury litigation, ambitious people aren&#8217;t tempted by it. That kind of work ends up being done by people who are &#8220;just trying to make a living.&#8221; (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners say this.) The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in, say, corporate law, or medicine. A comparatively safe and prosperous career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting to someone young, who hasn&#8217;t thought much about what they really like.</p>

<p>With such powerful forces leading us astray, it&#8217;s not surprising we find it so hard to discover what we like to work on. Most people are doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work = pain. Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige or money. How many even discover something they love to work on? A few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.  It&#8217;s hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do. So don&#8217;t underestimate this task. And don&#8217;t feel bad if you haven&#8217;t succeeded yet. In fact, if you admit to yourself that you&#8217;re discontented, you&#8217;re a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial.</p></blockquote>

<p>Definitely check out <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Grahams&#8217;s site</a> to get a taste for his articles or (for an easier time reading them) get his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596006624">book</a>.</p>

<p>By the way I&#8217;m working on a new design for StartBreakingFree.com (you can see most of it is up already).  More details on this coming up soon and other changes I&#8217;d like to make to the site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This isn&#8217;t specifically related to starting a business but I thought some people might find it interesting.  It gives you a little insight into computer science and will make you feel smarter.</p>

<p>You know those weird bunch of characters you see on the end of some URL&#8217;s?  You might have seen something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Please confirm your subscription by clicking here:
http://feedmailpro.com/confirm/dSrMq7Z2</p></blockquote>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t know, those random characters on the end are simply a code to identify you so that only YOU can confirm it and nobody else could guess it and sign you up without your consent.  Kind of like a password.</p>

<p><strong>But here is a more interesting question: how many characters is &#8220;enough&#8221; to make sure it&#8217;s secure?</strong></p>

<p>Well, to start with we know that everyone needs their own unique code, and there can&#8217;t be any duplicates.  Otherwise, you might accidentally confirm theirs instead of your own.  So let&#8217;s think for a minute about how many total subscribers could be in our system as sort of an &#8220;upper limit&#8221;.</p>

<p>For FeedmailPro let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re thinking big and want to have a million customers one day.  And on average each of those customers had 10,000 subscribers on their list (some more, some less).  That would be a pretty good business and we&#8217;d need enough codes for 1,000,000 * 10,000 = 10 billion subscribers.</p>

<p>10 billion sounds like a lot.  How many digits would the code need to be to make sure we had 10 billion of them?  For that we&#8217;ll do a little math&#8230;(easier than you probably think).</p>

<p>Well what if the code was only one digit long? It could be one of 26 lower case letters, 26 upper case letters, and 10 number digits (assume we can&#8217;t use any other special characters).  So that is 26 + 26 + 10 = 62 possibilities for a one digit code.  Interesting.</p>

<p>What if it was two digits?  (you can imagine aa, ab, ac&#8230;..ba, bb, bc&#8230;.Aa, Ab, Ac&#8230;.)  There are 62 possibilities for the first digit of the code, and 62 possibilities for the second digit.  So it turns out it&#8217;s just 62 * 62 = 3,844 posibilites.  That was a big jump.</p>

<p>After a minute you might start to see a pattern: that we really just have to multiply 62 by itself once for every digit that we have.   Even if we have 3, or 4 or 100 digits&#8230;there are really 62 possible characters for each position so we just multiple 62 * 62 * 62 * 62 &#8230;. once for each digit.  (Or as an exponent we&#8217;d say 62x where x is the number of digits.)</p>

<p>So getting back to our 10 billion subscribers, how long does the code have to be?  We whip out our calculator and see that&#8230;</p>

<p>623 = 238,328
624 = 14,776,336
625 = 916,132,832
626 = 56,800,235,584</p>

<p>Woah!  That was fast.  I don&#8217;t know about you, but this always surprises me.  Just 6 digits (a simple code like &#8220;abcdef&#8221;) and we&#8217;re already up to 56 billion!  That&#8217;s enough for every man, woman, and child on the entire planet to be subscribed to about 10 different email lists on FeedmailPro!</p>

<p><strong>Ok, but don&#8217;t break out the champagne yet.  We&#8217;ve got one more thing to worry about: what about the bad guys?</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually not quite enough to just have one code for everybody, because there are also bad people out there.  What if someone REALLY wanted to mess with your service?  They could start guessing random codes and trying them hoping to subscribe random people and generally wreak havoc on your system&#8230;causing it to go down or lose credibility!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not good.  So we have to ensure that not only does everyone have a unique code, but if you randomly try to guess one there is a VERY good chance you won&#8217;t get one.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s try a 10 digit code:</p>

<p>6210 = 8.39299365868e+17  (it&#8217;s big!)</p>

<p>Now we have a lot of possibilities.  In fact, lets say we had all 10 billion subscribers signed up.  How likely is it that someone guessing codes would get a code that belonged to one of them?</p>

<p>6210 / 10 billion = 84 million guesses!</p>

<p>Yep&#8230;they&#8217;d have to guess 84 million times on average before they could guess a valid code.  This is a worst case scenario also because in reality, I probably will never have 10 billion subscribers on FeedmailPro and many of those people will already be subscribed (in which case guessing the code is worthless) etc.  So the real chances of guessing a useful code would actually be much lower.</p>

<p>Still it&#8217;s useful to think about such things.  In today&#8217;s world, it&#8217;s actually conceivable that someone could use a bunch of computers to guess 84 million codes in a reasonably short amount of time.  If I was guarding the keys to a nuclear missile silo, 84 million probably wouldn&#8217;t be enough.  But In this case, subscribing some random person against their will is hardly the end of the world&#8230;and after all, they&#8217;d have to do another 84 million guesses to subscribe the next person (in which case you are hardly wreaking havoc&#8230;you are just a very lonely hacker wasting time in your Mom&#8217;s basement by subscribing 2 people to a newsletter they didn&#8217;t want).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>So I hope you found this interesting as a thought exercise!  Now you know a little more about computer science than you probably wanted to.  And the next time you&#8217;re wondering how many different combinations of outfits you can make with 4 shirts, 4 pants, and 4 pairs of shoes&#8230;you will know it&#8217;s 4 * 4 * 4 or 64.</p>
