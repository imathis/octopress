  <div class="entry-content"><p>Loyal Readers,</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I told you about a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-i-made-a-113-return-in-one-month-with-real-estate/">real estate deal I did that gave a 113% return in one month</a>.  Well, I am quite human and make mistakes just like anyone, so today I&#8217;m going to tell you about a real estate deal I did that DIDN&#8217;T go quite so well, and the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from it.</p>

<p>This was another foreclosure that I worked on rehabbing.  As more and more money was sunk into it, it no longer made sense as a rental, so I will have to sell this property now to probably break even.  At least I live to fight another day.</p>

<p>Here are a few before and after pics:
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/12/11.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/12/11-150x150.jpg" alt="Living Room" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/12/21.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/12/21-150x150.jpg" alt="Bathroom" /></a></p>

<p>Some mistakes&#8230;and lessons learned (which seem obvious, but somehow weren&#8217;t):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Put More Detail In The Contract</strong>
Perhaps the biggest mistake I made on this property had to do with the contractor who I hired to fix it.  I correctly got a signed contract with him, but didn&#8217;t make it detailed enough.  It was not specific and I let him convince me that a number of items would be included that were not specifically written.  Bottom line, what someone says doesn&#8217;t mean anything, only whats written counts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Withhold Final Payment Until You Are 100% Happy With The Work</strong>
I knew that I should always withhold the final payment until I was 100% satisfied with the rehab job.  I knew this, yet I didn&#8217;t follow it.  When I inspected the work, I was in a hurry, it was getting dark, and I wasn&#8217;t thorough.  Upon closer inspection it wasn&#8217;t done.  And of course, being already paid, the contractor had zero incentive to come back.  Never pay a contractor until you are 100% happy.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I realized that I need to build my confidence in dealing with and negotiating with these contractors.  For an great book on this subject, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWhen-Say-No-Feel-Guilty%2Fdp%2F0553263900%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1196835842%26sr%3D8-2&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">When I Say No I Feel Guilty</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bring As Little Money To Closing As Possible</strong>
I brought too much money to closing.  When I didn&#8217;t like the lenders numbers, I was afraid to back out (risking losing the earnest money and the deal entirely) so I convinced myself to go ahead with a deal I didn&#8217;t quite like.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lock In Financing Before Entering The Deal</strong>
The lender rules changed mid deal.  I thought I&#8217;d be able to do an 80% cash of refinance.  I was told part way through construction that the rules had changed and I could only go up to 75%.  Locking in the financing before starting he deal would have prevented this.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Of course the irony, looking back on this, is that I KNEW all of these things before I did this deal.  At least I knew them intellectually, but somehow I got myself in a situation where I didn&#8217;t do what I knew was right.</p>

<p>This brings me to another interesting point.  I was very upset at this particular contractor for a while, and considered even suing him, but I realized that I have no one to blame but myself.</p>

<p>Sure, he might have taken advantage of the situation, but I gave him the chance to do so.  I realized that I have to take responsibility for it, and not put my problems on to someone else.  In a way, I am actually grateful to him for teaching me this lesson.  It was an invaluable lesson that was worth far more than it cost me.</p>

<p>Finally, it has occasionally been a struggle to stay motivated during a deal like this.  I had to keep reminding myself that it is actually great this happened; I&#8217;m learning so much.  When a deal works out perfectly, you learn nothing.  When things go wrong is when you really start to grow as a person.</p>

<p>One of my favorite quotes is by the American industrialist Thomas Watson, who is famous for building IBM.  One time a reporter asked him how other companies can match the incredible success of IBM.  He replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s quite simple, really. Double your rate of failure. You’re thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn’t at all.</p></blockquote>

<p>You can be discouraged by failure or you can learn from it. So go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because, remember that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find success.</p>

<p>Going out and trying something new, and failing, is probably the best learning tool ever developed.  I was talking with a gentleman who owns over 400 houses to get his advice on this deal, and he told me that of the 400 houses he has bought, he has only lost money on 13 of them.  But he remembered each one of those 13, and he said he learned more on those than the others combined.  They were earlier in his career, and really it was the 13 that allowed him to have the 400.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;m glad I went out and did it.  Even if I make zero dollars, the experience will make the next deal that much better.  In fact, the next deal is already looking quite good&#8230;.like it&#8217;s going to have very little money down (nearly zero) and an outrageous rate of return.  I&#8217;ll keep you posted!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to Anjali for sending in this article where four millionaires are <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/RetirementandWills/RetireInStyle/MillionairesTellHowTheyDidIt.aspx">interviewed about how they got rich</a>.</p>

<p>The most striking thing to me (aside from the fact that 3 out of 4 quit their jobs to do it) is that they all persevered through incredible odds and difficult times.  They wanted it so badly they decided to just never give up.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re looking for a little inspiration on your quest for wealth, get tips from people who already have made their millions. These success stories run the gamut from Grammy-winning songwriter to first-generation entrepreneur to everyday people who simply lived below their means.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes people ask me questions like:
<strong>Why take the risk of quitting your job?</strong></p>

<p>I was just <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-education-how-to-devour-at-least-one-business-book-per-week-without-taking-any-additional-time-out-of-your-day/">listening</a> to Brian Tracy speak in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPsychology-Achievement-Develop-Achievers-Mindset%2Fdp%2F0743526589%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1195613270%26sr%3D11-1&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The Psychology of Achievement</a>, and he phrases it better than I could have:</p>

<blockquote><p>Every single peak performing human being, every single high achieving man or woman, has been a person who has thrown off the natural tendency to play it safe and stay within the comfort zone, and has continually tried to exceed their previous levels of accomplishment, has continually  moved forward into the risk zone, to try something more and bigger and better and more important.  Every single accomplishment in the history of man, has come from men and women who have had the courage to take the risks, to step out even though they had no guarantee or assurance of success.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPsychology-Achievement-Develop-Achievers-Mindset%2Fdp%2F0743526589%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1195613270%26sr%3D11-1&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/11/51kqstyhthl_aa240_1-150x150.jpg" alt="Brian Tracy Psychology Of Achievement" /></a>I would go as far as to say that it is IMPOSSIBLE to reach your full potential as a human being while spending a third of your life working for someone else.  Make a quick list of people who really changed the world, helped others, and were wildly successful.  Did they have a 9-to-5 corporate job?</p>

<p>I also love what Brian Tracy has to say about failure.  Most people don&#8217;t try, and those that do give up after the first or second time.</p>

<blockquote><p>In studying the lives and stories of the most outstanding men and women of all of history, we find that every single one of them has been a great failure.  People do not understand the importance of failure in achievement.  The fact is that it is impossible to succeed without failing, that failure is an indispensable prerequisite for success, and that all great success is proceeded by great failure&#8230;Every single person who has tried to accomplish something outside the ordinary has suffered setback and obstacle and defeat and adversity and disappointment and heartache over and over again as they have moved toward their goal.  There is no record of anybody ever having achieved any kind of success without having failed over and over again.  The only difference is that the winners continually pick themselves up and carry on knowing that ultimate success is inevitable as long as they keep on going on&#8230;your persistence is your measure of your belief in yourself.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/11/904328_plastic_houses1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/11/904328_plastic_houses1-150x150.jpg" alt="Real Estate Passive Income" /></a>This is the final part of my series on <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/6-ways-to-generate-passive-income-that-sometimes-work-part-1-blogging/">6 Ways To Generate Passive Income</a>.</p>

<p>Today we will discuss the final (and I think best) way to generate passive income.  As I stated in the first article:</p>

<p><strong>The way I evaluate any claim behind a method of building wealth or generating passive income is this: how many people can I find who have used this method to accomplish what I’m trying to do?</strong></p>

<p>One of the best things I ever learned about success is to simply find successful people and model what they are doing, while ignoring the advice that unsuccessful people give you.</p>

<p>Is real estate a reliable way to generate passive income?  Lets see&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/28/news/economy/millionaires/">CNN says</a> that &#8220;Forty-six percent of those surveyed [millionaires] own investment real estate&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="http://econedge.org/25/industries-with-the-greatest-number-of-self-made-millionaires-billionaires/">Economics Edge</a> says that the &#8220;real estate industry has produced the largest number of self-made multi-millionaires&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.briantracy.com/public/blog/188347">Best selling author Brian Tracy</a> did the research and says that 74% of millionaires are those who started their own business (included in this is real estate, but its unclear what percent).</p>

<p>(Interesting sidebar: less than 1% of millionaires consist of those who made their money in show business, sports, music, writing, inventions, or the lottery combined.)</p>

<p>So clearly real estate is a popular means of acquiring wealth.  Many others have used it successfully.  And investment real estate by its very nature is passive income.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you can validate this for yourself by thinking of the wealthiest people you know or have personally met at some point in your life.  Chances are they either (1) own a business, (2) own quite a bit of real estate, or (3) both.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at the pros and cons&#8230;</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Plenty of others have used it to build wealth for hundreds of years, a proven track record</p></li>
<li><p>Can get started part time while at your current job and with relatively little money</p></li>
<li><p>You can start seeing income quickly (a month or two) as opposed to years in starting some businesses</p></li>
<li><p>It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_%28finance%29">financial leverage</a>, a key to building wealth, through self colateralized loans.  (A bank wouldn&#8217;t loan you money to say, trade stock options, or start most other types of passive income businesses)</p></li>
<li><p>Tax benefits like depreciation, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1031_exchange">1031 exchanges</a>, etc which allow you to pay less or no tax on real estate income</p></li>
<li><p>A large customer base who will always need your product</p></li>
<li><p>Plenty of room for competition and new entrants into the market</p></li>
<li><p>Real estate is an asset that appreciates and automatically adjusts for inflation</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Certainly real estate isn&#8217;t without some risks.  Here are some cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Requires at least a little bit of money to get started, (perhaps $10,000)</p></li>
<li><p>Requires credit and the ability to borrow money</p></li>
<li><p>Has inherent risk to those without education or prior experience</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
What I&#8217;d like to leave you with is this: there are plenty of ways to make passive income, but we should evaluate each with a bit of skepticism.  If you find yourself asking &#8220;how do I know if this will work?&#8221; the first thing you should do is question the source of the information you are getting.  Has the person giving me this information actually done it themselves?  Are they rich or where I want to be financially?  If the answer is no, then take a step back and reconsider taking their advice.</p>

<p>In a larger sense we can look at how others have been having the most success, and then model it.  All I an tell you is that I&#8217;ve never personally met a millionaire who made their money from trading options, blogging, day trading, buying domain names, MLM, network marketing, or info products.  History and the research seem to validate this observation.  I&#8217;m sure those people do exist, but I have never met one.  I have, on the other hand, met a number of millionaires who own real estate.  Perhaps you have met some as well who may be willing to help you get started.  There is nothing magical about real estate, and it certainly caries its own risks, but overall it seems to be a solid business that reliably generates passive income.</p>

<p>Best of luck in your passive income endeavors!</p>

<p><strong>Discussion question: Who have you personally met that is in the financial position you want to be in, and how did they make their money?  Post your response below.</strong></p>

<p>The principles to building wealth really haven&#8217;t changed much in several hundred years, and this book has been around forever.  Building wealth isn&#8217;t that hard; just look at what successful people are doing and model it.  Trying to do things your own way or taking advice from those without a proven track record is what gets you in trouble.</p>

<p>The book is told in parable form.  Through some interesting characters and memorable stories the book is able to convey its lessons much more effectively than if they simply made a list of points to remember.  Even if they are talking about building chariots and selling sheep, the lesson still applies to modern day.  (Side Note: I find this is an effective technique in public speaking as well: make a point and then back it up with a personal story or anecdote.  It really drives the point home.)</p>

<p>As an excerpt from one chapter, here are seven cures for a lean purse, which each contain a story behind them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start thy purse to fattening</p></li>
<li><p>Control thy expenditures</p></li>
<li><p>Make thy gold multiply</p></li>
<li><p>Guard thy treasures from loss</p></li>
<li><p>Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment</p></li>
<li><p>Insure a future income</p></li>
<li><p>Increase thy ability to earn</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It bothers me when I see people using the touch pad on their laptop while at a desk for long periods of time.  I&#8217;ve never seen an official study done on it, but I&#8217;d guess that you are 25 to 30% faster using a regular external mouse instead of a touch pad.  The touch pad is only there for when you are on the move and don&#8217;t have access to anything else!</p>

You know, the sort of things that you typically have in the back of your mind that would be fun, but for whatever reason (sometimes laziness, sometimes because they are scary) you never get around to doing.  The sort of things that most people only TALK about doing, and never do because they&#8217;re stuck in corporate America.</p>

<p>I like to call these &#8220;peak life experiences&#8221;.  The type of experience where you can go home that day and feel happy knowing you did something unique.  These make great stories to tell your friends and family.</p>

<p>Here are a few that I&#8217;ve gotten around to in the past year.  Some started out as new years resolutions, others just came up through brain storming sessions like this one:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bought my first piece of investment real estate, and made it cash flow</p></li>
<li><p>Put up my business (University Tutor) for sale with a business broker</p></li>
<li><p>Took some acting classes</p></li>
<li><p>Hired a personal trainer</p></li>
<li><p>Took first place at a local speaking competition</p></li>
<li><p>Dated a girl I actually liked</p></li>
<li><p>Made a bunch of new female friends</p></li>
<li><p>Attended four conferences on various subjects (ongoing education)</p></li>
<li><p>Built a blog for my book, achieved a #1 page ranking on Google</p></li>
<li><p>Tried rock climbing, yoga, and joined a volleyball team</p></li>
<li><p>Tried stand up comedy at open mic night</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Here are some more I&#8217;d like to accomplish in the next year:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sell University Tutor for a nice profit</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase 10 pieces of rental real estate (at least $3000/month in passive income)</p></li>
<li><p>Buy a BMW M3</p></li>
<li><p>Get my concealed handgun license</p></li>
<li><p>Get a personal (virtual) assistant</p></li>
<li><p>Get booked/paid to travel to another city for modeling/acting</p></li>
<li><p>Get six pack abs</p></li>
<li><p>Make at least one quality post per week to this blog</p></li>
<li><p>Travel to Australia to surf</p></li>
<li><p>Take a helicopter tour of New Zealand</p></li>
<li><p>Visit at least four friends in different cities</p></li>
<li><p>Launch a new business (can&#8217;t disclose details right now, but we&#8217;ll call it codename BR for the moment)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>To me this is the most exciting part about being self employed: you have the freedom and time to do all of these things.  What &#8220;peak life experiences&#8221; have you been putting off?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ask someone what the three most important things in their life are, and in some order you will probably hear: health, wealth, and relationships.  The later includes friends, family, and lovers.</p>

<p>Is your job helping you improve each of these areas?</p>

<p><strong>Health</strong>: Chances are your job is the biggest source of stress in your life, could be preventing you from getting enough sleep, and forces you to eat unhealthy food while on the go.</p>

<p><strong>Wealth</strong>: The story that we&#8217;ve all been told as children (work hard in school, get a good job, work and save for 40 years) is a lie.  More than 80% of Americans end up flat broke in old age, totally dependent on others, and praying that they die before their money runs out.  Having a job is a way to make a living, not build wealth.</p>

<p><strong>Relationships</strong>: Spending 1/3 of your life at work means you can form great relationships with colleagues (although you rarely get to choose which colleagues you spend time with), but also means your time is limited with the others in your life.</p>

<p>Starting to work for yourself instead of being a slave to your job poses some interesting opportunities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A chance to build wealth as a business owner instead of being a wage slave</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced stress, no rush hour traffic, no boss, no annoying colleagues</p></li>
<li><p>The time to exercise regularly, shop for healthy food, and eat without being rushed</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to get enough sleep</p></li>
<li><p>More time with your family, friends, and lovers</p></li>
<li><p>The chance to meet more new people</p></li>
<li><p>An opportunity to work on what you want, instead of what is assigned to you</p></li>
<li><p>As many vacation days as you&#8217;d like</p></li>
<li><p>More control over what you do with your time every day of your life!</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a follow up to my previous article on <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-analyze-a-killer-real-estate-deal/">How To Analyze A Killer Real Estate Deal</a>, where I show you an actual property I looked at and purchased.  The property is now fixed up and rented out so I thought I&#8217;d take a moment to show you how it turned out!</p>

<p><strong>Fixing it up!  Before and After Pics</strong></p>

<p>The house got new paint inside and out, carpet, air conditioner, microwave, dishwasher, light fixtures, doors, landscaping, and a few other cosmetic things.</p>

<p>Here you can see the new AC, the old one was rather beat up!
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/ba11.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/ba11-150x150.jpg" alt="New AC" /></a></p>

<p>Here you can see the new microwave and dishwasher in the kitchen.  Overhead lights have been fixed, cabinets painted, etc.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/ba21.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/ba21-150x150.jpg" alt="Kitchen" /></a></p>

<p>White paint on the outside and raising the tree line improves the curb appeal.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/ba31.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/ba31-150x150.jpg" alt="Outside View" /></a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that I didn&#8217;t do any of these repairs myself.  I hired contractors so it was zero work on my part.  Total cost of the repairs were $14,500 and they took two weeks to complete.  I had the contractors lined up and ready to go the day after closing.</p>

<p><strong>Equity Capture</strong></p>

<p>I bought the house for $76,000 and put $14,500 worth of repairs into it.  In it&#8217;s newly repaired condition the lender appraised the house for $115,000.  So I now own a $115,000 house.</p>

<p> 115,000
-  76,000</p>

<h2>-  14,500</h2>

<p>  $24,500  Equity Capture</p>

<p>As you may recall from my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">previous article</a>, I financed this deal with a lender who loaned me 80% of the after repair value.  This allowed me to put very little money down.</p>

<p>I was hoping to get it with zero in the deal, but unfortunately that didn&#8217;t happen here (maybe on my next one).  Still, it worked out quite well&#8230;.there was no down payment, but including all repairs ($14,500), closing costs, appraisals, finance charges, etc&#8230;the total cash out of pocket that I have in this deal is $11,500.  (I brought $5,900 to the first closing, repairs went $3,100 over what was escrowed by the lender, and $2,500 to refinance out of the hard money loan into permanent financing.)</p>

<p>(24,500-11,500)/11,500 = 113% return on equity</p>

<p>Note that I didn&#8217;t have to wait a couple years for this to appreciate.  I raised the value of the property by this much in one month, just by fixing it up!</p>

<p>Of course equity capture is an &#8220;unrealized gain&#8221;.  I can&#8217;t go out and spend that $24,500 because it is tied up in the house.  But in a year or so I can do a 1031 exchange perhaps to sell some houses and get into an apartment, and I&#8217;d be able to get that equity out.  The lenders appraisal of $115k is a conservative one, and in a year it may have appreciated as well.  But even if it doesn&#8217;t (I don&#8217;t like to count on appreciation) it has still gone up in value just by rehabbing it.</p>

<p><strong>Cash Flow</strong></p>

<p>Getting a 113% return on equity is a nice way to raise my net worth, but the cool thing about this property is that it is also paying me with money I can actually use today.  In other words it &#8220;cash flows&#8221;.</p>

<p>I listed it for rent at $1,100/month.  This is slightly below rents in the area and it was in great condition so it only took about a week to get a lease signed.  The mortgage at 7.75% interest is $647/month.  Taxes are $270/month.  Insurance is $80/month.</p>

<p> 1,100
-  647
-  270</p>

<h2>-    80</h2>

<p>$103 per month positive cash flow</p>

<p>Right now the taxes are based on a value of the home of $112,000.  But since I just purchased it for $76,000, I should be able to get the tax value reduced to $76,000.  This would make the tax payment only $200/month instead of $270/month.  Paperwork has been filed for this but it will probably take another few weeks.</p>

<p>That would bring the positive cash flow per month to $173/month.</p>

<p>173 times 12 months is $2,076 per year</p>

<p>$2,076 divided by my total cash out of pocket of $11,500 gives an 18% cash on cash return.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall I&#8217;m happy with how the deal turned out.</p>

<p>In the future I think I can make it work even better by doing a few things differently: First, I&#8217;m going to try a different lender to see if I can reduce the finance charges.  I think I could do a lot better in terms of the origination fees, broker fees, and closing costs overall.  Secondly, I&#8217;m going to try and end up with much less money in the deal.  If that $11,500 was closer to zero the rate of return would go way up.  I&#8217;ve seen a couple deals where I could actually get it to zero, or even better, get cash back!  So I hope to do that soon.</p>

<p>That being said, the numbers really are quite staggering when you look at it.</p>

<p>113% return on equity
18% cash on cash return</p>

<p>Try getting that in the stock market!  And of course, my equity will continue to grow by about $100 each month as the tenant helps me pay off the principal.  Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention&#8230;the cash flow will be TAX FREE.  The $173/month in positive cash flow is really equivalent to $247/month of ordinary taxable income that you&#8217;d get from a job or some other source (assuming a tax rate of 30%).</p>

<p>Finally a big point to keep in mind here is that this is passive income.  It may be hard for some people to get excited about a couple hundred bucks a month, but the key point is that I will make it without doing any work (or very little).  Get 10 houses and now you have something&#8230;and income stream you don&#8217;t have to work for!  Plus of course the equity gain is much larger and will help build net worth quite rapidly.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some common questions I assume people might have, so I will try to answer them.  If you have others please post below.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Your cash flow won&#8217;t be $173/month because something will break in the house that you will have to fix.  And won&#8217;t you be getting calls in the middle of the night to fix things?  That doesn&#8217;t sound like zero work!</strong></p>

<p>I put in the lease that the tenant pays the first $250 of any repairs.  So all minor repairs are their responsibility and cost.  Larger repairs like the air conditioner are under warranty right now.  So hopefully this won&#8217;t be an issue.  I have to admit that the one expensive item not under warranty is the water heater, so if that breaks I may have an expense (minus $250 from tenant).  In the future I may try a home warranty company that I found which would be an easy way to cover all repair costs.</p>

<p>The house really only needs to stay in decent condition for about a year.  I plan on selling it in a year or two along with a number of other houses to get into an apartment complex.</p>

<p><strong>What if the tenant doesn&#8217;t pay rent or destroys the house?</strong></p>

<p>If they don&#8217;t pay I&#8217;ll evict (entire process takes about 20 days in Texas) and keep their deposit.  I did a criminal and credit check on them (and several other applicants) to try and select the best candidate.  I required them to pay double deposit (two months rent, $2,200) because their credit wasn&#8217;t perfect, so this provides a buffer.  Given that you can evict so quickly and keep two months rent, its possible to actually make MORE money in this type of situation, unless the damage is really quite substantial.</p>

<p><strong>What if it floods, a pipe breaks, a tree falls through the roof, etc?</strong></p>

<p>These type of claims are covered by the insurance.</p>

<p><strong>What about vacancy?  You should account for that in your numbers.</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t account for vacancy because it took me 1 week to rent the house initially.  It is now one of the nicer houses in the neighborhood and I deliberately charged a rent ($1,100) slightly below market value to attract more people.  I feel confident that if I need to evict I can rent it again in a week or two.</p>

<p><strong>You didn&#8217;t really make a 113% return because you can&#8217;t spend that money.</strong></p>

<p>You are right.  Return on equity is an &#8220;unrealized gain&#8221;.  I can&#8217;t go out and spend it, but it is real money that belongs to me.  It is just tied up in the house.  Note this is different than saying &#8220;I think it has gone up&#8221; or &#8220;I think it will go up&#8221; like when talking about appreciation.  The house is worth that right now, and I was able to raise it&#8217;s value by that much in one month by fixing it.  This is much more certain than betting on appreciation because you can see what other properties in the area are selling for.  The lender (who has an incentive to estimate conservatively) appraised it at $115,000 so I feel confident it&#8217;s worth at least that much.</p>

<p><strong>Anyway, I am happy with how it turned out and learned a lot to hopefully make the next one better.  If you see any errors or have questions/comments please leave a comment below!  Thanks!</strong></p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is part 3 of my series on <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">generating passive income</a>.</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve looked at how Blogging is a good idea, but doesn&#8217;t generate passive income.  How eBooks and information products have been wildly successful for some, but are overall not a reliable way of generating passive income (the success rate is low).  And today we&#8217;re going to briefly cover three other common passive income generating ideas.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/url1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/url1-150x150.jpg" alt="Virtual Real Estate as Passive Income" /></a><strong>Virtual Real Estate</strong></p>

<p>Just as in &#8220;real&#8221; real estate where there is a limited supply of dirt that appreciates in value, there is a limited supply of domain names on the internet which are also increasing in value.</p>

<p>Virtual real estate is the concept of buying up domain names either to monetize them today or because you believe they will increase in value.  Some people like John Reese seem to think that this is going to make a <a href="http://www.marketingsecrets.com/blog/archives/000038.html">whole bunch of millionaires in the coming years</a>.  And it certainly has already created a handful of them, like <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/06/01/100050989/index.htm">Kevin Ham</a> who has a portfolio of domains worth over $300 million.</p>

<p>Of course, the first complaint you will hear is that all <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">the good domain names are taken</a>!  Some have taken a unique approach, like Russell Horowitz who focused on <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/09/27/technology/marchex.biz2/index.htm">&#8220;local&#8221; domain names</a> (instead of sunglasses.com he is buying houstonsunglasses.com or newyorksunglasses.com) or Craig Lovik who bought domains with common misspellings in them.</p>

<p>Overall domain names will continue to go up in value, although I haven&#8217;t seen any good data on appreciation percentages.  The three main concerns I have with virtual real estate is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many of the websites that are created are &#8220;junk&#8221; sites that have no purpose and are just filled with adwords.  If you aren&#8217;t contributing something of value to the world, it&#8217;s going to be hard to make money in the long run.</p></li>
<li><p>The gold rush of the internet is done, and almost every conceivable good domain name has been picked over thoroughly.  There is now a fairly liquid market of domain names; the biggest site I know of for buying/selling these is <a href="http://www.sedo.com">sedo.com</a>.  You can make money off appreciation, or maybe even find a valuable domain name that hasn&#8217;t been discovered yet.  But I doubt you could do this with enough regularity for it to be profitable, and even if you could generate income this way it sounds like hard work (not passive).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, going back to my old measurement of &#8220;how many millionaires have used this method to become rich?&#8221;, the numbers don&#8217;t look good.  I&#8217;d be surprised if virtual real estate has created more than 100 millionaires in the world.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/buildingnetwork1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/buildingnetwork1-150x150.jpg" alt="Networking Marketing MLM Passive Income" /></a><strong>Multi Level Marketing and Network Marketing</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of these types of companies for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Everyone I&#8217;ve spoken to who is involved in these companies claims to know someone who is a millionaire from it, but I&#8217;ve still yet to meet a single Millionaire doing MLM or network marketing.</p></li>
<li><p>You end up annoying your friends and family by sending them information about various products and you&#8217;ll end up convincing yourself that you are really trying to help them by letting them know about a great product.  They don&#8217;t want to hear from you.</p></li>
<li><p>It comes back to the old idea of are you contributing something of value to the world.  I&#8217;m sure there are some MLM companies out there who do this, but I haven&#8217;t seen one yet.</p></li>
<li><p>These companies tend to take advantage of unsophisticated buyers, which raises an ethical red flag for me.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t have much more to say about networking marketing.  I&#8217;m sure there are some millionaires created from these businesses and plenty of people will disagree with me on this, but I think they should be avoided.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/box-spread1.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/10/box-spread1-150x150.gif" alt="Option Trading Passive Income" /></a><strong>Options</strong></p>

<p>Options are not all bad.  In fact, by <em>selling</em> options you can mitigate risk on various investments and large companies buy options on a regular basis which is solid business practice (Southwest bought fuel options to guarantee a price, McDonalds buys beef options, etc).</p>

<p>However, buying options as a way to make a living is generally a bad idea I think.  Again, I&#8217;ve seen some classes on this and spoken to a number of people who have tried it.  Every single person I&#8217;ve met (maybe half a dozen) who tells me they do option trading, I ask the same question: &#8220;when will you make enough to quit your job and live off your option trading?&#8221;  None of them have plans to do this and they tell me that it&#8217;s more of a side hobby, which interpret as meaning it can&#8217;t be very profitable.</p>

<p>That isn&#8217;t passive income in my book.  The only people I know making millions in option trading are doing it as a job at a large company, and of course they aren&#8217;t trading their money, so it&#8217;s not their millions.</p>

<p>If someone can find some info on how many millionaires have been made from option trading please post it here, but for right now I remain unconvinced.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>So far things look pretty bleak for passive income ;)  The final part (part 4) will cover real estate which as you might have suspected looks a little better for passive income.  Stay tuned!</p>
