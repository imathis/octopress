<p>The previous site was a newsletter with a standard opt in page to capture emails.  I never felt quite right about that site&#8230;it always seemed a bit too sales-letterish and dishonest.  The emails were at times intrusive&#8230;you continued to receive them whether you&#8217;d asked or not.</p>

<p>This worked fine in the past, but as I watch the net <a href="http://www.blogwriteforceos.com/blogwrite/enewsletters_vs_blogs/index.html">evolve</a>, I think consumers have started to get tired of that model.  When you&#8217;ve seen one landing page, you&#8217;ve seen them all.</p>

<p>I like the blog format because it helps build trust right away.  You can view others participating and see the real message up front.  You don&#8217;t ask anything of the reader until you&#8217;ve delivered and earned their trust.  And blogs are focused primarily on educating (in other words whats in it for YOU the reader, as opposed to me the author).</p>

<p>It sure didn&#8217;t hurt to see several marketing experts using blogs on their own sites, including <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> and <a href="http://income.com/blog/">John Reese</a>, both of who I&#8217;d recommend.</p>

<p>Of course blogs primarily use RSS instead of Email for subscriptions, but most people don&#8217;t know what RSS is yet.  So for right now I&#8217;ve created a hybrid blog that still includes an email option.  I created it with WordPress, which I have been absolutely thrilled with as a platform.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got some exciting ideas for this blog that will be comes over the next weeks and months.  Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;ve ever been to Texas, you may have noticed a peculiar beverage for sale called St. Arnold&#8217;s Beer.</p>

<p>It comes in a distinct bottle, with a picture of St. Arnold himself (the patron saint of brewing) right on the label, and it happens to be the most successful micro brewery company in Houston.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/05/acf4341.jpg" alt="acf434.jpg" />But St. Arnold&#8217;s was not always the profitable small business startup that it is today. In fact, their 13 year history is full of false starts, missed opportunities, and near failures.</p>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to meet Brock Wagner, the founder of St. Arnold&#8217;s, and his story had a profound effect on me. It all started back in 1994, when Brock had an important realization: time was running out.</p>

<p>At the time, Brock was working in the financial services industry making a good salary, but he realized one day that time was running out. He didn&#8217;t want to spend the rest of his life at a job he didn&#8217;t love.</p>

<p>He sat down one day and made a list of what he loved. Near the top were two items: drinking beer, and making beer.</p>

<p>To the average person, these may have seemed like poor opportunities for a career change. After all, his entire background was in financial services. What was he going to do, go drive a delivery truck for Budweiser?</p>

<p>But Brock decided to just follow his heart, and set about getting financing to create Houston&#8217;s first micro-brewery.</p>

<p>From the beginning there were problems with his small business startup idea. Money was scarce for such a risky venture. Investors were reluctant to put their hard earned dollars into a business where the founder had no beverage industry experience. But after more than a year, Brock had secured barely enough to get started (one of his early investors was Kenneth Lay of Enron, which is an entire other story).</p>

<p>Several years into the project, Brock had secured a facility, constructed all the brewery equipment, and was ready to start making beer! But about a week before he was ready to launch, there was another major setback: a city inspector who had been testing the pipelines made a mistake with a pressure valve, and ended up destroying $100,000 worth of brewery equipment, in just 30 seconds!</p>

<p>What a blow, and just a week before they were set to launch. The next few years were spent in various courtrooms before being reimbursed by the city, but Brock was not deterred. He raised more money, rebuilt the facility, six months later finally shipped his first bottle of St. Arnold&#8217;s beer.</p>

<p>It should have been a time to celebrate, but initial sales of the product were disappointing. In fact, five years after shipping their first bottle of beer, St. Arnold&#8217;s had yet to turn a profit. How easy would it have been to pack things up and go home? Even the most die hard entrepreneur would have admit defeat after five years right? Maybe Houston wasn&#8217;t ready for it&#8217;s own micro-brewery.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Brock&#8217;s business partner decided to back out of the company. Brock bought out his shares (generously ensuring that he would at least recover his initial investment, even though the company was losing money) and they parted on good terms.</p>

<p>This was the lowest point for St. Arnold&#8217;s, and for Brock. With a struggling business, and very few customers, it was difficult to stay optimistic. But over the next five years, Brock was able to slowly but surely turn the company around. Today St. Arnold&#8217;s is not only profitable, but it is admired and loved as a Houston tradition. People ask for the product if a particular bar or restaurant doesn&#8217;t carry it, and the brewery holds a tour every Saturday that is open to the public. Houston and St. Arnold&#8217;s have become synonymous, and it is all due to Brock&#8217;s refusal to accept defeat.</p>

<p>As entrepreneur&#8217;s we can learn a lot from Brock&#8217;s story, as we attempt our own small business startup.</p>

<p>First, never, ever, ever give up. I have yet to hear a single story of a successful small business startup that didn&#8217;t face setback after setback. It took Brock a year to raise enough money. Most people would have quit after a few months of failed meetings. The week before his launch all his equipment was destroyed in a freak accident (at a cost of $100,000). Most people would have given up then, after such bad luck. And finally, after five years of losing money, Brock continued to persist, after nearly everyone would have admitted defeat.</p>

<p>Second, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the only reason Brock succeeded is that he loved what he was doing. If he had to face all those setbacks and he didn&#8217;t even like making beer, he surely wouldn&#8217;t have been successful. Loving your job and company is a prerequisite for success in any small business startup, because even if things look bleak, at least you are doing what you love.</p>

<p>The challenge for us all is to find our own St. Arnold&#8217;s Brewery&#8230;a business we love. And to spend as long as it takes to make it successful, no matter what setbacks we may encounter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/05/steps1.jpg" alt="steps.jpg" />I’m going to share with you here the process that almost every successful entrepreneur went through to getting their business started – condensed into just four basic steps.</p>

<p>I’ve become convinced that entrepreneurship is quite simply one of the best things you can do for yourself – assuming you do it the right way (by following the steps below).</p>

<p>Those who become successful business owners end up having total freedom in their life, improved health, better relationships, and more money.  I don’t even remember what rush hour traffic feels like, and I work in my underwear some days if I feel like it!</p>

<p>I don’t claim that it is easy to build a successful life as an entrepreneur, but is certainly possible for anyone who wants it badly enough.</p>

<p>These four steps as essential, and if you REALLY do them&#8230;your probability for success as an entrepreneur is quite high.  If you can’t even do these four, then you quite simple aren’t serious about becoming a successful business owner.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are the four time tested steps to starting a successful business.  This also serves as a guide for how you should use this website:</p>

<h3>STEP 1 – Decide What You Want</h3>

<p>You think you know what you want, but have you ever taken the time to actually write it down?  Don’t feel bad, ninety-nine percent of people never have.  If you don’t know what you want&#8230;the chances of you happening to STUMBLE upon it one day are slim to none.</p>

<p>Three important points to remember about writing it down: (1) make sure it is measurable, (2) give it a deadline, and (3) write down some compelling reasons WHY you must get it.  If you had to earn $1 Million next year to save your child’s life, I bet you would find a way to do it!  If you don’t really want it, then you will never be a successful entrepreneur.</p>

<h3>STEP 2 – Learn Every Day</h3>

<p>You need to start soaking up new information like a thirsty sponge.  The problem is that you’ve been flooded with incorrect messages from the day you were born.  Messages about money, risk, how to start a business, and quite frankly WHAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF.</p>

<p>You are going to need a completely different mindset to start THINKING like a successful entrepreneur.  Your beliefs are going to have to change.  The only way I know of to do that is slowly over time by putting tons of positive new stuff into your head.</p>

<p>You are going to have to start reading a ton of books and articles, meeting other people, discussing with them, and getting your hands on every entrepreneurship resource you can find.</p>

<p>My book is just one such resource and there are plenty of other good ones.</p>

<p>It’s nice to say “Ok I will start reading more”, but here are three ways to make sure it happens by automatically increasing the amount of learning you get done: (1) listen to audio programs and books on tape in your car or during your commute (you have to drive anyway, so the books will automatically get read, this is HUGE) and (2) learn how to speed read (yes it really works).</p>

<h3>STEP 3 – Emulate the Best</h3>

<p>Want to know how smart people mess up starting a business?  They are so smart that they think they can do it their own way!  Big mistake&#8230;.the best way to get success is to look at people who already have it and do what they do.</p>

<p>What this means is that you need a new group of friends.  You need to get rid of all those people in your life who are unmotivated, belittle your ambitions, and complain about their crappy jobs even though they will never leave!</p>

<p>You also need to get at least one really good mentor who you meet with regularly.  How should you meet all these new people?  You need to start becoming a master networker and quite simply, you can&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help.  You might be surprised how willing people are to help if you simply ask.</p>

<h3>STEP 4 – Take Action, Over and Over Again</h3>

<p>Are you a thinker or a doer?  You’ve probably met some thinkers in your day.  They love to discuss ideas all day, hold lots of meetings where nothing gets done, and have plenty of good ideas.  They can be wonderful people, but unfortunately they will never be successful entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>The best idea in the world isn’t worth a dime in the hands of a thinker.  Successful entrepreneurs are DOERS who study time management, work off written to-do lists, and get excited about results.</p>

<p>If you’re not a doer, there is good news.  You can become one.  It’s also easy to get lots of work done when you really love the business you start.</p>

<p>Reading and learning (step 2) are great but if you just keep doing that forever, waiting for the right time, then you aren’t an entrepreneur.  Actually taking action is scary, but you’ll never be entirely ready and will have to act ANYWAY.  Entrepreneurs, act in spite of fear and follow the philosophy of ready, fire, aim.</p>

<p>Finally, as you’re taking action&#8230;you are going to fail.  A lot.  You could fail 100 times before you get your first success, but you know what?  That is GREAT!  Every time you fail you will learn a valuable lesson.  Failing early and often (and small) is actually a REQUIRED step to becoming a successful entrepreneur.</p>

<time datetime="2007-05-28T21:40:46-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 28<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Breaking Free, I make a big point of how important it is to incorporate your business.</p>

<p>It makes sense for a couple of reasons.  First, because it protects you from personal liability, and second, because it offers you some great tax advantages.</p>

<p>For today, let&#8217;s just focus on the personal liability part.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/05/safe1.jpg" alt="safe.jpg" />Incorporating your business protects you from personal liability, because it essentially separates you from the business.  When you incorporate, your business becomes like another person.  This other person has it&#8217;s own bank account, it can own things like property, and it can take risks.  Even if that &#8220;other person&#8221; (your business) goes completely bankrupt or gets sued, YOU (and your personal assets like your house, car, savings) are safe.</p>

<p>This is important because many new businesses fail, but you as the entrepreneur don&#8217;t want to fail.  You want to pick yourself back up and start your NEXT business which will be even more successful.  Failure is a necessary way to learn, so we want it to be as painless as possible.</p>

<p>Of course, I have to admit that what I wrote above is a a &#8220;best case scenario&#8221;.  When everything works like it should, then yes, you PERSONALLY are protected.  But there are certain situations where your corporate status doesn&#8217;t help you out, and every business owner should be aware of them!</p>

<p>You see, setting up a company gives you so much protection from liability, that unethical people in the past have tried to take advantage of it.  They have created a &#8220;shell corporation&#8221;, in other words a business just for the purpose of liability protection, to help them get away with a crime.</p>

<p>Of course, the law had to be modified to weed out these people and make sure they were appropriately prosecuted.  But in the process, the requirements for honest small business owners became TOUGHER.  Some extra steps are now required to make sure your corporate status stays intact.</p>

<p>By the way, whenever a court decides to waive the corporate protection and actually prosecute the owners behind the company PERSONALLY, they call it &#8220;piercing the corporate veil&#8221;.  (Lawyers always like to come up with fancy names for things.)</p>

<p>Following are the top five ways to protect you personal assets then starting a business.  Make sure you do these correctly, and you can be sure that even if your business experiences a colossal failure, or gets sued out of existence, at least your personal assets are safe and you can start over.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h3>Never Engage in Fraud or any Criminal Act</h3>

<p>If you commit a crime, the corporate veil isn&#8217;t going to protect you one bit!  Never sell a product you know is defective or doesn&#8217;t work, misrepresent something in your advertising, forge any signatures, or pull a bait and switch (offer a great deal to get people in the door only to tell them it is out of stock so you can sell a substitute.)  Run your business HONESTLY and with INTEGRITY every day, and it will pay off in the long run.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h3>Never Misrepresent Your Corporate Officers or Members</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t ever lie about who is involved in your company.  When it comes time to ask for investors, or get people to support you, you may be templed to exaggerate about who is actually working with you.  If they haven&#8217;t actually SIGNED your operating agreement, then they aren&#8217;t your partner.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h3>Make Sure Your Follow All Corporate Formalities</h3>

<p>If you are going to claim you are a company, then you&#8217;d better act like a company.  That means you have to file all important documents and keep them on file (your operating agreement, articles of incorporation, and DBA for example).  You also have to keep detailed financial records.  In Breaking Free, I provide samples of these documents and show you exactly how to create them yourself.  This will literally save you thousands of dollars in legal expense because you won&#8217;t have to pay a lawyer to create them for you.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h3>Keep Your Business and Personal Assets Separate</h3>

<p>The business has to have it&#8217;s own bank account.  The money in that bank account is not YOUR money.  It belongs to the business. In fact, if you decide one day come along and take some money out to buy yourself a Hawaiian vacation, that is called embezzlement (a crime)!  Many first time business owners (especially if they are the sole owner) don&#8217;t understand this concept.  The money in the company is not theirs.  The company is like a separate person, and all assets must be kept separate.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h3>Never Treat the Business&#8217; Assets as if They Were Your Own</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t deposit your personal checks into the corporate account. Don&#8217;t use company money to finance your personal life and hobbies.  Don&#8217;t lend the company car to your buddy for a weekend excursion.  Don&#8217;t set up a cot in the back of the office and start living there!  Again, the business and yourself are two separate people.  Treat them accordingly.</p>

<p>With these five basic steps, you will be well on your way to protecting your personal assets in the event your business goes under.</p>

<p>Many successful business people, from Donald Trump to John D. Rockefeller, went through periods of ups and downs in their life. Not every company they bet on was a success.  But they managed to survive and lived to fight another day because they where smart enough to INCORPORATE correctly.  They followed the above five steps to make sure they wouldn&#8217;t lose their corporate status in the event of a lawsuit.  They made sure that their PERSONAL assets were safe, even if the COMPANY went bankrupt.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/05/decision1.jpg" alt="decision.jpg" />Have you ever heard the term INTRA-preneur?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a play on the word entrepreneur that basically means &#8220;being an entrepreneur inside a big company&#8221;.  In other words, it&#8217;s someone with a regular job who has a boss just like everyeone else - except they have the MINDSET of an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>But what does that mean exactly?</p>

<p>An intra-preneur could be someone who leads a new project within the company, like the launch of a new product.  This would have similaries to a launching a new company based around a single product because they&#8217;d still have to manage a team, look at a new market, and generally wear may hats.</p>

<p>An intra-preneur could also mean an engineer who thinks about the business in a broader sense.  Most engineers are 100% focused on the technical work that consumes their time, but if an engineer was also involved in, say&#8230;.bringing in new clients for the company, and making sales&#8230;.he or she would be thinking like an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Having an intra-prenurial mindset within a company is great, and I&#8217;m sure it would help you in your job.  But there is one major problem with being an intra-preneur: YOU DON&#8217;T REAP THE FINANCIAL REWARDS LIKE A REAL ENTREPRENEUR!</p>

<p>Lets say that through networking you brought in a large new client for the firm.  Let&#8217;s say that through analysis outside your normal job you optimized part of the manufacturing process and saved the company 2% on every sale.  Let&#8217;s say you helped start a new division of the company that went from 0 to 25% market share in one year!</p>

<p>After all that, you would get a pat on the back and probably even get a big promotion or bonus.  But you would never be compensated for the full 100% of the value you added to the business.  You could save the company $1 Million&#8230;.and if you were lucky they&#8217;d give you a $10,000 bonus.  It just doesn&#8217;t add up.</p>

<p>The reason is simple: the business (and those who own it) get the profit.  Not you.</p>

<p>A friend of mind (we&#8217;ll call him JR) has a great entreprenurial mindset, but before he fully embraced it he spent some time working at a fortune 500 company as a frustrated intra-preneur.</p>

<p>One of JR&#8217;s first tasks on the job was to look at the benefits program.  It was costing the company millions.  Their work force wasn&#8217;t getting any younger, and the medical coverage for the elderly workers was becoming a major concern for management.</p>

<p>He did some research for months and eventually put together a proposal that would cut costs while still giving the employees the health coverage they deserved.  The company was initially inclined to go with a different proposal that was put together by two outside consulting firms, but after many meetings JR convinced them his plan was better.</p>

<p>It turned out he was right.  In the first year after implementing his proposal, the company&#8217;s multi-million dollar benefits expense had been reduced by 15%, and everyone was thilled.</p>

<p>JR sure got some BIG thank-you&#8217;s from his superiors that year, but do you think he saw any of that money?  NOT ONE CENT.  And that was one reason he eventually decided to use his entreprenurial mindset in his OWN business.</p>

<p>You see, if you have great ideas and really believe in yourself, then why shouldn&#8217;t you reap the rewards?  Why should you have to spend time convincing the higher ups that you&#8217;re right, when you KNOW that you are right?</p>

<p>Being an intra-preneur is a great idea, but to me it simply defines someone who is an entrepreneur at heart, but too afraid to go out on their own.  (I used to be one of these, so don&#8217;t feel bad.)  You will be continually using your greatest gifts to make someone ELSE rich.</p>

<p>If you know an intra-preneur or happen to be one yourself, stop selling yourself short and get into business for yourself!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many first time entrepreneurs over the years have stopped to ask themselves, &#8220;Should I get more experience at a big company before going out on my own?&#8221;</p>

<p>This is true of recent college graduates who are deciding between regular job offers and a startup.  This is also true of people who have been in industry for twenty years.</p>

<p>So how much experience do you really need before going to work for yourself?  The answer of course, is that it depends.</p>

<p>On the one hand, there is a lot to be said for getting a &#8220;real job&#8221;.  This is what I did after college, and it ultimately helped me start working for myself because it gave me the confidence to know what I really wanted.</p>

<p>Here are some advantages to getting more experience:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It made me realize that I actually COULD get a job with a good salary.  This might sound silly, but I guess you can think of it as a safety net.  In the back of my mind, I knew that if I gave entrepreneurship my best shot and it didn&#8217;t work, I could always get another job.  I knew that if I was about to be so broke that I couldn&#8217;t pay my rent, I&#8217;d have a backup plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere deep down I had a fear of what other people would think about me being an entrepreneur.  It took me a long time to admit this to myself, but I didn&#8217;t want anyone to think &#8220;he is an entrepreneur because he couldn&#8217;t get a real job&#8221;.  The brain works in funny ways, but at least if I was quitting a good job to go out on my own, it would somehow have more credibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Seeing what I DIDN&#8217;T want helped me discover what I DID want. If I had never found out how much I hated working for someone else (the long hours, no sleep, boring work, etc) then being my own boss wouldn&#8217;t seem so great!  I wake up excited every morning because I know what the alternative is.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Notice that I didn&#8217;t put &#8220;I got more experience that helped me start a business&#8221; as one of the advantages.  I learned a lot in my time working for other people, but I can&#8217;t think of a specific skill that really helped me as an entrepreneur.  It was entirely different.  Of course, since I was always learning it helped me in indirect ways.  I met other intelligent people, my writing got better, I networked&#8230;but you don&#8217;t have to have a big corporate job to do this.  I continue to do those things today just as much while working for myself.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s look at the other side: how could &#8220;getting more experience&#8221; prevent you from accomplishing your ultimate goal of starting a business?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#8217;s perhaps the biggest excuse in the book.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t have enough experience&#8221; is used by so many people for why they CAN&#8217;T start a business, and it really is just that: an excuse.  In reality, the time will never be perfect to go out on your own, but entrepreneurs make it work.  They realize that they&#8217;ll have to learn things along the way, and probably fail at times, but that they will get it done no matter what.  Quitting my job was probably one of the hardest decisions I ever made, because I was downright SCARED of what would happen.  I was scared of failure, what people would think, etc&#8230;and &#8220;I don&#8217;t have enough experience&#8221; is a very convenient excuse in that type of situation.</p></li>
<li><p>People get stuck at their corporate jobs.  The real danger of &#8220;getting more experience&#8221; is that once you get there you won&#8217;t be able to leave due to financial reasons!  Often times when we are earning a good salary, and getting raises, it&#8217;s easy to spend that money.  You might buy a new car, and get some swanky new condo, and before you know it you&#8217;ve taken on DEBT (mortgage and car payments).  The problem is that now you CAN&#8217;T leave your job working for someone else because you&#8217;ve over extended yourself and CAN&#8217;T afford to miss a single car or house payment!  This is known as getting caught in the rat race, and can quickly make you a slave to your corporate job.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you are going to go work for someone else, make a conscious effort to SAVE your money rather than SPEND it.  Put 25% of it away every month before you can even SEE that money.  Build up your cash reserves, because starting a business becomes much easier when you have six months of cash in the bank to get started with.</p>

<p>The bottom line is this:  Go to work for someone else (or stay there) for a while if you have to.  I don&#8217;t blame anyone who goes this route because it is exactly what I did.  It will let you know if the corporate world is the right place or not, and give you the confidence to know you have a backup plan in case you should ever need to get one of those &#8220;real&#8221; jobs again.  BUT, take an honest look at yourself and make sure you aren&#8217;t using &#8220;I need more experience&#8221; as an excuse not to start your company. And for goodness sake, don&#8217;t start spending all the money you make there on expensive cars and houses!  You could easily get stuck in a job you dislike just because you can&#8217;t afford to miss a payment!</p>

<p>I know you&#8217;ll make the right decision.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many first time entrepreneurs partner up to start their first business.</p>

<p>This is quite understandable considering that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#8217;s their first business and it&#8217;s reassuring to have someone else &#8220;figuring it out&#8221; along with you</p></li>
<li><p>Usually your skills complement each other.  So, for example, one partner will be good with accounting, marketing, taxes, and numbers in general while the other partner will be the &#8220;technical&#8221; person who engineers the product.  This pair is just one example.  Obviously there are plenty of other combinations where the partner&#8217;s skills complement each other.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are short on cash it&#8217;s hard to hire people, so sometimes an attractive option is to trade ownership in the company (this is essentially all a partner is) to get more people on your team.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This reasoning all makes sense on the surface, but I&#8217;m here to tell you something a little counterintuitive:  DON&#8217;T TAKE ON PARTNERS WHEN STARTING A BUSINESS!</p>

<p>This is one of those cases where I think the conventional wisdom is wrong.  In fact, I think the more partners you have all grouping together, the more problems you will have.</p>

<p>Before I proceed, let me be clear: I am not saying that you should start a business without the help of anyone else!</p>

<p>You should of course have good mentors, brainstorm with others, learn from others, and delegate to others.  But I DON&#8217;T think you should have partners (two or more people who are equally invested and in charge of the company).</p>

<p>Here are a few reasons why:</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h3>Disagreements go Unresolved</h3>

<p>Discussions, disagreements, and differences of opinion come up all the time in the work place, and ultimately they have to come to a conclusion.  For example, some people may want to launch the product on time even though it is only 75% complete, while some OTHER people may want to delay the launch of the product until it is 100% done.</p>

<p>At a typical company, it&#8217;s up to the leader (whether it&#8217;s the CEO, President, manager etc) to just make a decision and move on.  Some won&#8217;t agree, but at least everyone is on the same page.</p>

<p>The reality is that probably EITHER decision would wind up being ok, as long as SOME decision is made.  The worst thing they could do is make NO decision.  Endless discussion and debate would continue while nothing else was getting done!</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is what happens if you ever have two people in charge who disagree (e.g. partners or co-presidents).  There is no single person at the top in the chain of command, so no decision can be made until both people agree.</p>

<p>Partners can generally compromise or work out most disagreements, but there are always a certain percentage of decisions that both feel passionately about and they can&#8217;t agree!  What ends up happening is that resentment starts to build and progress stops.  A contest starts to take place as to who is actually in charge!  To see a great example of this, checkout the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5QV?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00005N5QV">Startup.com</a>, which is a real life documentary about a startup company.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h3>Everyday Work Takes Longer</h3>

<p>Even just simple everyday decisions take longer when you have partners because, again, there are two people in charge. Simple things, like approving a revised draft of a document, now get sent to two people instead of one.</p>

<p>What this means is that a constant flurry of emails and phone calls are going back and forth between the partners that could be done much faster by one person in charge.</p>

<p>Each partner wants to include the other on all communications as a courtesy.  After all, wouldn&#8217;t it be rude to approve something or make a decision without consulting your partner first?  Delays, delays, delays.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h3>They Often End Badly</h3>

<p>Want to know a guaranteed way to mess up a friendship or relationship?  Go into business together!</p>

<p>No matter how close you are to someone right now and how much you trust each other, chances are that going into business with them will put a serious strain on your relationship.  In fact, there is a fairly high chance that you will end up never speaking again or end up in court!</p>

<p>How can this be?  I admit, it&#8217;s tough to believe, and when a great opportunity comes up to start a business with a partner, most people will fill forget this and go for it anyway.  It&#8217;s almost as if the little voice in our head says &#8220;you know, I remember hearing something about how you should never go into business with a friend, but I&#8217;m going to push that aside for a moment.  This opportunity is just too good to pass up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Maybe this is one of those lessons most people have to learn the hard way before it really sinks in!</p>

<p>Partnerships end for all kinds of reasons.  One common one is that one or both partners will start to feel like the other isn&#8217;t pulling their weight.  Often we get caught up in our own work and don&#8217;t see the value someone else is contributing.  We start to have thoughts like &#8220;man, I could hire someone to do what little they are doing, and stop giving them half the profits!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another is that one partner could lose interest and have other priorities eventually.  Do they still deserve their 50%, should they take a pay cut?  Talk about an awkward conversation to have!</p>

<p>Finally, problems of trust and loyalty seem to always come up as well.  When it comes to money, we human beings are funny creatures.  We get suspicious for all kinds of reasons, real or imagined.  When it comes to money, it&#8217;s very easy for feelings to get HURT.</p>

<h3>Personal Experience</h3>

<p>I learned this lesson the hard way.  The first three businesses I started were with partners.  Thinking back, the only reason I did this was FEAR.  I simply didn&#8217;t have the confidence to start a business on my own and thought I needed other people&#8217;s help.  When it came time for number four, I vowed to be 100% owner this time no matter what!</p>

<p>Of the three partnerships I was involved in, none of them worked out particularly well.  The first person, I occasionally keep in touch with but I lost all trust for him and wouldn&#8217;t do business with him again.  The second person I am still friends with, but our friendship was certainly strained while we were partners.  I eventually bought him out and we have remained good friends ever since.  The third, I stopped speaking to and parted ways with after a messy closing of the company that cost us both money.  I later reincorporated on my own.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not saying your experience will be exactly like mine, and there are examples to be found of successful partnerships in the business world, but lets just say I don&#8217;t think your chances are good!</p>

<h3>What is the Alternative?</h3>

<p>Finally, there must be a better way.  Why don&#8217;t you just NOT partner with friends or family members?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in practice this is impossible.  Friends and family members are the only people you would ever really get into business with.  After all, who else is left?  Strangers and enemies?</p>

<p>The better solution is to just not start a business with a partner at all.  Ever.  Have the confidence in yourself that you can figure it out and get help when you need it, but you don&#8217;t need to share the profits with anyone!</p>

<p>Surround yourself with great people.  Have good MENTORS who are more successful than you that you can bounce ideas off and get great advice.  Have a NETWORK of people to review products and documents and give you feedback.  And have WORKERS (either independent contractors, or outsourced work) to do the things that you don&#8217;t know how to do.</p>

<p>Partners are unnecessary and could lead to the downfall of your company.  Don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you!</p>

<p>And do check out that movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5QV?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00005N5QV">Startup.com</a>.  It really is quite good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Breaking Free, I talk at length about the importance of developing good habits.  I do so with good reason, because habits can simultaneously be your greatest strength (if they are good) and your greatest weakness (if they are bad).  What&#8217;s remarkable is just how dependent we are on habits as human beings.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, PEOPLE DON&#8217;T CHANGE.</p>

<p>You can beg them, plead with them, argue logically with them, appeal emotionally to them, and threaten them, but at the end of the day those people will fall back on their old habits.  In fact, you could say that human beings are little more than habit forming machines!  The only way we can change is from within.  By deciding we will change for ourselves, not because someone else wants us to.</p>

<p>I remember reading a story about a martial arts master who had studied and taught for more than 30 years.  After getting his black belt in judo at a young age, he went on to study many other disciplines including Tae Kwon Doe, Thai Kickboxing, Brazilian Jujitsu, and Kung Fu.  One day he was leaving his house when a carjacker ran up to him and waved a knife in his face, demanding his wallet and keys.  Instinctively, the master disarmed the man and threw him to the ground in one perfectly executed judo throw.  The police were called, the carjacker was arrested, and the master took a moment to let his adrenaline subside.  It was then that he realized what had happened. Despite studying martial arts for 30 years, it was his oldest habit of judo that his brain reverted back to in his moment of need.</p>

<p>It had been imprinted upon him through REPETITION at a young age, and never left despite years of additional training. How can we use the power of habits to our advantage?  The secret lies in repetition.</p>

<p>Building positive habits into your daily routine is an essential skill that all successful people use.  When they face an insurmountable problem, they break it into small chunks and build a new habit to chip away at it.</p>

<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you had a sales target of $1 Million this year for your business.  Why not develop the HABIT of spending half an hour on marketing every single day for a year.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you wanted to lose 50 lbs?  Why not develop the HABIT of jogging for 20 minutes five days a week.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you wanted to write a book.  Why not develop the HABIT of writing non-stop for an hour, three days a week.</p>

<p>Unsuccessful people will get super motivated one day and try to do it all at once!  They might work for 12 hours straight on marketing and spend their entire budget, starve themselves and run 5 miles in a day, or write furiously for an entire weekend. After expending all their energy, they&#8217;ll be exhausted and quickly slip back to their old habits.  Moreover, they will be disappointed at the mediocre results, and the painfulness of the experience will condition them not to try it again.</p>

<p>Successful people, on the other hand, take a different approach because they understand the power of HABITS.  They don&#8217;t over exert themselves!  Instead, they break it into small steps. Spending half an hour a day on marketing is easy enough and can even be an enjoyable activity, jogging for twenty minutes fits nicely into their schedule, and writing for only an hour leaves their mind fresh and full of ideas.</p>

<p>A year later the successful persons&#8217; superior HABIT will have paid off ten fold and the unsuccessful person will be in the same spot they were a year ago.</p>

<p>Aristotle once said that: &#8220;We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.&#8221;</p>

<p>What major problem have you been facing in your life or business?  Looking at the whole thing can be scary and lead to avoiding it all together.  Instead, break it into small chunks, and develop the HABIT of doing a little bit on a regular basis.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever had a tough decision to make?  If you&#8217;re anything like me you were probably flip flopping back and forth all day, trying to get some more information, and generally being really STRESSED OUT.  Finally, your brain just gives up and creatively came up with a way to distract you, by filling your day with little tasks&#8230;check your email, read some articles, make some calls, etc.</p>

<p>I call this &#8220;creative avoidance&#8221; (I don&#8217;t think I came up with this, but I can&#8217;t remember where I saw it first).  The stress of making this important decision is painful, and since our minds are designed to avoid pain, it will &#8220;invent&#8221; small easy tasks to fill your time.</p>

<p>The problem with tough decisions and creative avoidance is that they can be huge time wasters.  The decision causing you all that stress is typically the most important thing you need to get done that day, but it&#8217;s also the only thing you aren&#8217;t making progress on!</p>

<p>About a year ago I was starting a new company.  I had made lots of progress by incorporating, developing the product, deciding on a name, and plenty of other things, but I just couldn&#8217;t decide on a logo.  I had hired someone to make some sketches, but none of them came back great.  Then I designed a bunch on my own, but none of them looked quite right. Finally, I had a few of my graphic artist friends put together some sketches, and still nothing was jumping out at me as being perfect!</p>

<p>As I sat there will all these sketches in front of me (actually they were thumbnails on my computer), I just couldn&#8217;t make a decision.  I narrowed it down to about 5 designs, and asked the opinion of some friends.  Their comments varied so much that there wasn&#8217;t a clear winner.  This was starting to really stress me out, and my creative avoidance kicked in!  I tried working on other things like the website, press releases, and the final revisions to the product, but everywhere I turned the logo was holding me back.  I couldn&#8217;t launch the website without a logo, I couldn&#8217;t send out a press release without a logo, and I couldn&#8217;t engrave the product with my logo!</p>

<p>I realized one day that this logo decision was holding back my entire progress and I&#8217;d probably spent far too much time on it already.  I resolved to decide that day, no matter what, and just went with my gut instinct.  I really wasn&#8217;t sure I&#8217;d made the right choice at the time, but it allowed me to make progress and freed up my mind to focus on more important things.</p>

<p>This story illustrates an important point: AS ENTREPRENEURS WE MUST BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH INDECISION.</p>

<p>Part of the job description is that there will be tough decisions to make and it&#8217;s our job to make them!  In fact, whenever a tough decision comes up, take a moment to say to yourself &#8220;awesome, this is why I&#8217;m so successful, I take tough decisions and make the right choice, I&#8217;m about to make some big progress&#8221;.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t allow yourself to be paralyzed by decisions.  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been to meetings before where everyone talks and talk but nothing is decided!  It&#8217;s very frustrating, but the reality is that everyone is too scared of making a mistake down the road, so they don&#8217;t act and nothing gets done.</p>

<p>As it turns out some great research has been done on the topic of decision making and EIGHTY PERCENT OF DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE RIGHT NOW, EVEN IF YOU ONLY HAVE PARTIAL INFORMATION!</p>

<p>Of course there are those few decisions that have such far reaching implications, it&#8217;s worthwhile to get some more info. The way you remove the stress from these big decisions is by deciding a date to make the decision, no matter what.</p>

<p>Even if you still don&#8217;t have all the information by that day, you must decide.  If everyone involved knows there is a deadline to make the decision, they can plan around it and minimize their worry.</p>

<p>I think you will find that your fears about making the wrong decision are almost always overestimated.  We as human beings tend to vastly overestimate that type of thing.</p>

<p>General George S. Patton had a few choice words on this subject, including:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Be willing to make decisions. That&#8217;s the most important quality in a good leader.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would rather have a good plan today than a perfect plan two weeks from now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Thank you George!</p>
