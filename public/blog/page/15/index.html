  <div class="entry-content"><p>About four months ago I <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-get-a-free-solar-flashlight/">wrote</a>&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Congrats to this blog breaking the 1000 subscriber mark! It’s been a little more than a year since I got started. I think the next 1000 will go ever faster as we build momentum. Thanks to everyone who subscribed and commented!</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m pleased to report that as of today is has broken the 2000 subscriber mark and the Feedburner icon is currently displaying 2,037 subscribers.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that interesting?</p>

<p><strong>The first 1000 subscribers took 13 months.
The second 1000 subscribers took 4 months.
How long will the next 1000 subscribers take?</strong></p>

<p>This is what&#8217;s referred to as a positive feedback loop.  The more subscribers you have, the easier it is to get new subscribers.  Why?  Well there are a few factors&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Social proof.</strong>  If someone casually stops by the blog and sees there are lots of people participating and reading it, they are more likely to stick around.  Maybe those other people know something I don&#8217;t?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Organic search results.</strong>  Google is fully aware of the number of subscribers to this blog (they own Feedburner).  Google ranks sites with more subscribers higher in search results.  As a result, the more subscribers you have the more traffic you will get from search engines which in turn brings more subscribers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Word of mouth.</strong>  If 2000 people get every message you send out, then they more people will forward it to their friends, digg it, bookmark it, etc.  You get a network effect and more referrals with more subscribers.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>One final thing I did to boost subscriber numbers is that I finally broke down and got an <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/aweber">Aweber account</a>.  They handle the email subscription part of the blog so that when somebody types in their email (instead of subscribing to the RSS feed) they will get updates from the blog.</p>

<p>To be perfectly honest, I don&#8217;t think Aweber is a very good service.  To get the emails looking right was a huge hassle and I already found several bugs in their system.  However, it is the best thing out there and the pros outweighed the cons.  The good things about it are that it allows you to create some popup offers for people to subscribe and the email subscribers count toward your Feedburner icon.  You can also schedule email delivery better than with Feedburner.  Overall, I&#8217;m glad I did it despite the hassle.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting about 25 new subscribers per day with Aweber in place (not counting new RSS subscribers), and at that rate&#8230;.I&#8217;ll be at 3000 subscribers in just 40 days!  As I&#8217;ve written about in the past, blogging is not an <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">overnight way to generate passive income</a>.  But if you can stick through it for a few years by having a topic you are truly interested in writing about&#8230;it can finally start to build momentum and turn into a nice passive income business.</p>

<p>I think StartBreakingFree.com is finally getting closer to that tipping point of being a popular blog.  As with most passive income businesses, there is a disproportionate amount of work up front for very little reward.  The real payoff comes down the road.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762424931?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0762424931">Skinny Bitch</a> (don&#8217;t recommend it) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841666?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591841666">The Dip</a> (highly recommend it).</p>

<p>Both were short, tiny little books with big type.  A few years ago I would have looked down on these books because I figured the author was trying sell a whole book with half the material.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see it that way now because I know it is harder and more valuable to be concise.</p>

<p>In fact, the first time I wrote that last sentence, I wrote it as: &#8220;But now I don&#8217;t see it that way at all, because I know it is harder and often much more valuable to say something in fewer words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Being concise gets your message across more powerfully and memorably.  It&#8217;s respectful of other people&#8217;s time.  And it often requires you to write just as much as a long winded version - except you take out all of the crap and leave only your best material behind.</p>

<p>I like (and am much more likely to read) short blog posts and short emails.  I believe it was Ben Franklin (?) who once apologized for writing such a long letter - he did not have the time to choose his words carefully and write a short one.</p>

<p>After writing an email today, see what can be taken out and still convey your message.  It will make your writing better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few drips of water from the pipe under your sink hardly seems like a big deal, but a month later it may may have caused a whole bunch of damage.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t see your hair and fingernails grow, but each month they require your attention for some trimming.</p>

<p>To you it&#8217;s just a home, but due to appreciation it could magically be worth $100,000 more when you wake up five years later.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/11/drip1.jpg" alt="" />
<strong>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brtsergio/2279908675/">brtsergio</a></strong></p>

<p>What&#8217;s the point?  <strong>There is great power in things which &#8220;just happen&#8221; whether you focus on them or not - even if they happen very slowly.</strong></p>

<p>This is true because we have a limited amount of time and mental energy to use each day.  It is our most precious resource.</p>

<p>Most people use that time and mental energy in exchange for money.  The problem is that they must continue to trade their time and energy every time they want to earn more money.  Why don&#8217;t more people focus it on building something that will generate passive income - income that happens whether they focus on it or not?</p>

<p>The answer is simple, they don&#8217;t do it because the initial results are pitiful!  You could spend a TON of time finding/buying/fixing/leasing the right piece of investment real estate or getting a passive income business going, and in the first month be left with a measly $50 in cash flow.   It hardly seems to make sense.  Meanwhile someone else working a job that month could have brought home $5,000 for the same amount of hours and made you look like a fool!</p>

<p>But they would have missed the power in what you did, and that&#8217;s why most people will never be rich.  Sure, it&#8217;s only $50.  But you&#8217;ve now created something that will happen passively.  It will happen whether you pay attention to it or not.  You have created that leaky pipe - except now instead of ruining the floor it is filling up a bath tub (your bank account).  You&#8217;ll come back some time later and that drip will have been working for you the whole time.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the best part: <strong>your time has been preserved</strong>.  Since you still have all your time and mental energy at your disposal, you can go off and create another drip.  With two drips working for you, you can go off and create a third, etc.</p>

<p>One day you&#8217;ll wake up with an army of drips working for you generating all the cash you&#8217;ll ever need, and your unfortunate counterpart will still be spending his time and mental energy to get a paycheck that month.  Meanwhile, your time and energy will still be preserved to focus on whatever you&#8217;d like (more drips, charity, culinary school, curing cancer, writing your auto-biography etc).</p>

<p>You might look like a fool up front, but preserving your most precious resource (time and mental energy) by building passive income streams is the besy way to get rich.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past I&#8217;ve written that one of the best ways to test out a business idea is to throw up a quick website for it.  This is inexpensive and will help you get feedback for your idea and possibly your first few customers.</p>

<p>In the past <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/a-new-business-website-from-start-to-finish-in-4-hours/">it took me about 4 hours using Wordpress</a> and I thought that proved how easy it was.  Well now you can do it in about 30 MINUTES!</p>

<p>I came across an really cool service yesterday called <a href="http://www.weebly.com">Weebly</a>. It does the Wordpress technical mumbo jumbo for you (uploading files with FTP, etc) and gives you a totally graphical way to install and build the site!</p>

<p>It is super easy and well designed.  In about 10 minutes I was able to create this test site with a professional layout, contact forum, blog, complete forum, and blocks for Google Adsense.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/11/picture-21.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/11/picture-21.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>They will host the site for you for about $4/month and you can pick your own domain name.  Now you have NO EXCUSE not to get your business idea going!</p>

<p>One final bonus trick: pick a domain name that <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-use-domain-names-to-improve-your-google-rankings/">contains the primary keyword</a> you&#8217;d like to rank for in Google.  This will help you get on the first page of Google for that search term - which means customers!  Boom, you have your own business.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Hi Brian,
I really enjoyed reading your articles! Thanks! What type of advice would you give for someone who is about to graduate college&#8230;go out into the workforce first to get &#8220;established?&#8221; Or take the entrepreneurial route from the beginning? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks so much.
Katie</p></blockquote>

<p>Hi Katie,</p>

<p>I struggled with that too when I graduated.  Basically, I took the money and after college went to do consulting.  I only lasted there 3 months before I quit to work for myself.  But in a way I&#8217;m glad I did it, because at least I knew what I was missing by quitting.  If I had just gone right into entrepreneurship, then when the going got tough (and it will) I probably would have questioned my decision more.</p>

<p>I also had an insecurity I think that people would say &#8220;he became an entrepreneur because he COULDN&#8217;T get a job&#8221;.  It sounds silly, but I think this was a fear that I had and I wanted to prove them wrong.</p>

<p>Your friends will probably be out driving fancy new cars, using company credit cards, and traveling for their jobs, etc.  This can be intimidating if you are just starting out in your own business and are feeling broke.  You&#8217;ll start to second guess your decision.</p>

<p>The benefits of entrepreneurship might not be as obvious up front, but pay off in spades later.  For example, you haven&#8217;t given up 40-80 hours of your life each week for another person&#8217;s goals, you won&#8217;t have to sacrifice health/sleep/freedom for a paycheck, and you can eventually end up much wealthier than your friends.</p>

<p>So I guess I&#8217;d say if you are on the fence, going to get a job for a while can be beneficial in the sense that it can reaffirm your belief about what you DON&#8217;T want to go back to.  This can be the motivation that helps you really get your own business going.  It can be the reason <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/why-i-must/">why you must</a>.</p>

<p>Just don&#8217;t get STUCK in that job by going out and spending the new money you&#8217;re earning with big expenses like car payments and house payments.  You can just as easily become a slave to your job by having such high expenses that you CAN&#8217;T quit.  If you decide to, try setting a specific date in your mind when you will force yourself to quit.  This will help you prepare for the transition and encourage you to take action.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!
Brian Armstrong</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Cutie with a bootie&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Junk in the trunk&#8221;.</p>

<p>These popular phrases spread throughout our culture like wildfire.  Why?</p>

<p>It has something to do with the repetitive sounds in the phrase.  It rhymes and is melodic.  Rappers have stumbled on an interesting psychological effect with phrases like these: they bounce around in your head and get stuck there.  They&#8217;re impossible to forget!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just rappers either.  Have you noticed that a lot of popular brands also have repetitive sounds?  How about Coca Cola (the &#8216;c&#8217; sound), Google (the &#8216;g&#8217; sound), or Toyota (the &#8216;t&#8217; sound).</p>

<p>Celebrities often change their names for a similar effect.  Marilyn Monroe, Jon Bon Jovi, and Chevy Chase are all examples.</p>

<p>It could be the vowel sound that repeats (assonance), the consonant sounds (consonance), or just the beginning letter (alliteration).</p>

<p>You can even win a trial by making sure &#8220;if the glove doesn&#8217;t fit, you can&#8217;t convict&#8221; is the last thing to stick in the jury&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to think of a slogan or description for my tutoring business which uses the same principles.  Super duper tutors?  Not sure, it&#8217;s still a work in progress.</p>

<p>But what&#8217;s clear is that repetition of sounds is a great marketing tool.</p>

<p><strong>What other examples can you think of?  More importantly, how can you use this in your own business to build your brand and stick in people&#8217;s minds?  Brainstorm for a second and leave us a comment below!</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The whole idea of retirement is based on the assumption that you dislike what you&#8217;re doing enough to want to stop one day.</p>

<p>Instead, you should be pursuing &#8220;financial freedom&#8221; - the moment when your passive income exceeds your living expenses - because then you can really start to do your life&#8217;s work.  Maybe you&#8217;ll try to cure malaria like Bill Gates.  Or maybe your &#8220;work&#8221; will be for a charity that doesn&#8217;t pay a dime.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This comment came from a Breaking Free reader by the name of Caleb.  I thought others might find it useful so I decided to highlight it here:</p>

<blockquote><p>Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I’ve noticed that wealth generation falls into one of two categories: Income and Growth.</p>

<p>Income puts food on the table today.</p>

<p>Growth builds over time until your net worth itself becomes income (by interest from investments).</p>

<p>Growth is almost always passive by nature. INCOME usually requires some kind of sweat equity, at least up front.</p>

<p>The two are often inverse compliments of each other. If you own a rental free and clear, you maximize INCOME (pure cashflow). If you fully leverage the equity of the property instead, you may end up with negative cashflow, but now you own more than 10 times as much real estate, all appreciating (GROWTH).</p>

<p>You cannot have growth without income first to pay the bills. So I am focusing my study and learning on INCOME-type methods.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed you’ve dipped into Real Estate, Blogging, Speaking, and other forms of INCOME methods. Could you please do a comparison of all the income methods you’ve explored, with a by-number breakdown of how profitable they have been? I suspect your Real Estate deals win hands down, but I’d happily be proven wrong…</p>

<p>I’m probably not alone in still exploring all the different INCOME options out there, without having yet settled on which one to devote my full time to learning.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great blog.</p>

<p>Hi Caleb, good points. You’re right there is often a trade off between income and growing net worth. I see this especially in real estate (where, as you pointed out, it&#8217;s referred to as equity vs. cash flow).</p>

<p>I try to mix both in my real estate deals. They all cash flow a little bit, while capturing some nice equity.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say for sure yet which method is best for passive income generation since I basically try a bunch of things and some work out better than others.  Every business I start has varying degrees of success and every real estate deal gets different results.</p>

<p>But when I have a bit of capital, I invest in real estate.  When I don&#8217;t have capital to play with I try other methods of generating passive income like starting web businesses or bloggin (which don&#8217;t require much capital).</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a big point actually.  You don’t have to wait until you have large amount of capital or net worth to get passive income.</p>

<p>Blogging I see as passive income because although it takes “work” to write, it takes the same amount of work whether 100 people read it or 100,000 people read it. So there isn’t a direct correlation between time &amp; income like a salary job. In a regular salary job, you’re unlikely to get a 1000% raise for doing the same amount of work, but it can happen in blogging just by your number of readers growing over time.</p>

<p>The other type of passive income businesses I like (which don’t take much capital) are web businesses like my tutoring site (www.universitytutor.com). It was started with very little capital ($100 and my own time) but provides passive income.</p>

<p>So to sum it up, I guess I think about it more in terms of 3 categories. (1) growth or net worth (2) passive income, and (3) regular income from a job.</p>

<p>Most people start at #3 and that is the lowest level.  There is no doubt that the best source of regular income is a typical 9-to-5 job.  It’s stable and far less risky than being an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>But while at that job you should try transitioning to passive income so you aren’t stuck there forever. If you have capital, invest in income generating assets like real estate. If you don’t, you can try building a passive income business which doesn’t require capital. Web businesses, blogs, review sites, etc.  Reinvest what income you do have to keep the cycle going.</p>

<p>Eventually, you should reach a point where your job income has been replaced by your passive income and you will never have to work again (or more accurately, your REAL life&#8217;s work can begin because you won&#8217;t be working for money anymore).  This is the definition of financial freedom.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing up this great question!  It helped clarify it in my own mind as well.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If your goal is to make a passive business, sometimes you have to find creative ways to <em>automate</em> tasks which would otherwise be performed by a human being.</p>

<p>Case in point: someone recently started spamming my <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com/">tutoring site</a> with messages like these:</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/11/picture-61.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/11/picture-61.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This type of scam shows up often on CraigsList.com and it just recently hit my site for the first time.</p>

<p>By the way, if you haven&#8217;t seen it before it goes like this: the person makes an offer to pre-pay a large amount up front.  They send you a phony money order.  After you&#8217;ve received the fake money order they say they are going to have to cancel and ask for a partial refund.  You send them a refund (with real money), and a week later the bank comes back to inform you that the money order you tried to deposit was fake.</p>

<p>You can spot these because usually (1) the person is out of country (2) the grammar is poor (3) they will refuse to talk to you on the phone (3) they want to make a large payment up front.</p>

<p><strong>Manual Process vs. Automated Process</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s annoying for the tutors to receive these messages, and it might be tempting at this point to create a &#8220;manual review&#8221; process where a human being would look at each tutor request before it gets sent.</p>

<p>This however, wouldn&#8217;t be very passive.</p>

<p>Instead, you can often use your &#8220;community&#8221; of users to be a police force for you.  Wikipedia (and a number of other sites) have employed this model very successfully with a self policing community.</p>

<p>The solution I came up with was to add this line to the end of all emails:</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/11/picture-71.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/11/picture-71.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Then I built a little system so that if enough people report the spammer, the account will get deleted and they won&#8217;t be able to bother anyone else.</p>

<p>Some interesting things to think about when building a system like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you notify the spammer that their account has been banned/blocked.  They will probably start using new email addresses or be more motivated to get around your system.  Instead, I set it up so the spammer gets NO INDICATION that their messages are being blocked.  That means they will happily go about trying to send new messages and working hard&#8230;UTTERLY WASTING THEIR TIME as punishment.  Maybe this subtle form of punishment will eventually cause them to reconsider their line of work since it will accomplish nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t want to ban the person if just one person flags them as a spammer.  The tutor could use this maliciously if they want to avoid getting negative reviews or block the user for any other reason.  Therefore you must try to get a &#8220;consensus&#8221; from the community by getting a few different opinions.  The exact right number is debatable, but the more people mark them as a spammer the more confident you can be about banning them.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Most business owners don&#8217;t think about the cost of answering one extra phone or email.  &#8220;It will just take a second&#8221; they say.  It makes them feel busy (which is very different than being productive) to solve easy problems.  Instead, they should be working &#8220;on&#8221; their business, not &#8220;in&#8221; it.</p>

<p>If you want to make a truly passive business, you need to put systems in place to handle 99% of whatever might happen automatically.  Even if your automated solution works only 90% as well as the human solution, it will still be worth it.  Every phone call or email DOES count, because you want to scale your business up to 100 or 1,000 times it&#8217;s current level without hiring any employees.  Hiring employees isn&#8217;t the answer (managing/hiring/firing them is just another job and isn&#8217;t passive).  Instead, focus on building business systems to automate as many tasks as possible.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a file always on my desktop titled &#8220;Why I Must&#8221;.</p>

<p>Inside it, I&#8217;ve written down (over the last year or so) the reasons why I must become financially independent working for myself.</p>

<p>There are about 20 reasons (some of them personal), but for example, I know that I can never really contribute to the world if I have to spend 40 hours a week working for someone else.  There just isn&#8217;t enough time.  I also know that it is the only way I&#8217;ll be able to travel the world for a year and continue to earn money.  These are important goals in my mind.</p>

<p>Why is it so important to have a reason you MUST?  Well, if it&#8217;s just something you WANT, instead of a MUST, then when you hit the first setback (and there will be many) you&#8217;ll give up.</p>

<p>What is your reason?  Is it spending more time with your kids?  Is it building your dream house?  Is it being financially able to provide for your family?  Whatever it is please take a moment to write it down (in the comments if it isn&#8217;t too personal).  If you don&#8217;t write it down, it doesn&#8217;t count.</p>

<p>That way, when you hit your first setback and stop to ask yourself &#8220;why am I doing this?&#8221;, you&#8217;ll have an answer.</p>
