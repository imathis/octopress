<time datetime="2007-07-09T13:35:54-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 9<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/water-buffalo1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/water-buffalo1-150x150.jpg" alt="I Purchased A Water Buffalo In The Name of Marketing" /></a>This is day 22 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new traffic to this website and demonstrate that <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">blogging can be a profitable and inexpensive business to start</a>.</p>

<p>My three tasks for the day were&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>I purchased a Water Buffalo.  No really&#8230;I did.  Here&#8217;s why: I submitted this website to the <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/landing-page-makeover-seomoz/">Copywriting Maven&#8217;s Makeover Service</a> so that they can provide a critique of my website and help me sell more books.  The service is free but it requires a donation to <a href="http://www.heifer.org/">Heifer International</a>, so I donated a water buffalo.  Ok fine, it was a &#8220;share&#8221; of a water buffalo for $25, but still.</li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s amazing how powerful just asking the right questions can be.  For example, in filling out the application for the marketing makeover, they asked me to provide any metrics I had on click through rates and conversion rates for who was purchasing the book.  What I came up with is that 0.24% of people who visit this website end up purchasing the book (which is pretty dismal), but that fully 7.6% of people who visit the <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">page where the book is sold</a> end up buying (which is outstanding and way above average, I almost don&#8217;t believe it!).</p>

<p>I think what this means is that I&#8217;m not going a good job letting people know about the book when they come to this website.  More people would probably buy, but they just aren&#8217;t seeing the page.  Did you know that there was a book for sale on this website?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I created some new content for this site (other than the marketing challenge) with the article on <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/apples-best-free-marketing/">Apple&#8217;s Marketing</a>.  I&#8217;ve started keeping an idea file for post ideas whenever something pops into my head.  I had the thought for that article about a week ago and let it sort of percolate in my subconscious for the last week before writing it today.</p></li>
<li><p>I started writing a new article for <a href="http://www.problogger.net">ProBlogger</a> on why RSS is so confusing to people and how to structure your site to make it easier to get subscribers.  Now that the draft is finished, I&#8217;ll most likely give it a once over later today and send it to Darren.</p></li>
</ol>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/angels_macs021.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/angels_macs021-150x150.jpg" alt="Allesandra Ambrosio and Gisele Bundchen MacBooks" /></a>A lot of people recently have been talking about how <a href="http://www.income.com/blog/2007/06/22/the-greatest-marketing-campaign-in-history-the-apple-iphone/">brilliant Apple&#8217;s marketing</a> has been recently.</p>

<p>I beg to differ.  Ironically, the reason that Apple has such great marketing, is that they don&#8217;t spend much time thinking about marketing.  They spend all their time thinking about their products and making them useful.</p>

<p>Was their buzz generating announcement of the iPhone brilliant marketing?  No.  Plenty of companies do product announcements before their launch with press releases and all sorts of methods.  The iPhone generated buzz because of its features like the user interface (and the benefits those features would provide).</p>

<p>Were the ads they created for the iPhone brilliant?  No, they were actually very simple.  But they showed <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/">brilliant features being used</a> from a first person perspective.  They were effective because the iPhone was effective, not because of how the ads were designed.</p>

<p>And of course, one of the least talked about yet most effective forms of marketing that Apple has benefited from, is that their products keep showing up in hands of the right people.</p>

<p>Al Gore&#8217;s An Inconvenient Truth, which was one of the best examples of how to use visual aids in a presentation, was inadvertently an ad for Apple.  If a Al Gore uses a MacBook, maybe I should too, was the subconscious message.
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/gore1.jpg" alt="Al Gore MacBook Apple An Inconvenient Truth" /></p>

<p>MacBooks also seem to show up surprisingly often in the <a href="http://www.ted.com">Ted Talks</a>, which are a virtual who&#8217;s who of people doing the top research and most interesting work anywhere in the world.  For example check out New York Times Columnist <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/7">David Pogue&#8217;s hilarious talk on simplicity</a>.
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/pogue-macbook1.png" alt="David Pogue Uses A MacBook - Free Advertising For Apple" /></p>

<p>They also seem to be a favorite of celebrities, like Victoria&#8217;s Secret models Allesandra Ambrosio and Gisele Bundchen, and regularly show up in the background of press photos.  It&#8217;s not product placement, these people actually just use Mac&#8217;s more than PC&#8217;s, despite the numbers being flipped in the regular population.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the point of all this?  People are too focused on Apple&#8217;s marketing.  Apple isn&#8217;t seeing more success lately BECAUSE of their marketing.  They are getting effective (and in some cases free marketing) because they don&#8217;t focus on marketing.  As <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX1Lz8PDgg8">Steve Jobs says</a>, they focus on creating useful products that people love, and the rest sort of takes care of itself.</p>

<p>Where else have you seen Apple products appearing that provide them with &#8220;free advertising&#8221;?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/813683_accounts_41.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/813683_accounts_41-150x150.jpg" alt="Personal Balance Sheet and Finance" /></a>This is day 21 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new readers to this website and demonstrate that blogging can be a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">profitable and inexpensive business to start</a>.</p>

<p>I spent the day preparing a personal balance sheet and discussing it with my mentor to track my own wealth building goals.  I&#8217;ll post on this in more detail shortly.</p>

<p>My three tasks for the day to market this site are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>I created a quick video to upload to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> as a marketing tool.  As you know, YouTube gets a ton of traffic and is one of the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-top-five-ways-to-market-your-business-for-free/">top five free ways to market your business</a>.  It was pretty fun to make this video and if it gets some traffic I may make some more.  I have plenty of quick things like that I could teach about finance.</li>
</ol>


<p>I used <a href="http://www.shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html">iShowU</a> to record it (for the mac) which was really easy.  If you have a PC you can use something like <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">Camtasia</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I learned for next time is that I&#8217;m going to have to zoom in or make the text bigger, it&#8217;s not quite as legible as I would have liked.</p>

<p>The video is about how to use excel to answer this question: how much should I save each month to become a millionaire by the time I&#8217;m 50?
[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C8WU7SECZI[/youtube]</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I remembered that I paid for an <a href="http://www.articlemarketer.com/">Article Marketer</a> account a while back and I haven&#8217;t been using it as much as I should.  It is a service which will take your articles and make them available in a large number of directories.  People can then find your article and use it as content on their own sites, if they include your link at the bottom.  Essentially, this is a way to syndicate your writing and get links to your website.  I submitted the article on Toastmasters that I wrote for MindPetals and the article on Cell Phone Companies.  I should remember to do this more in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a new article for <a href="http://www.lifehack.org">LifeHack.org</a> on creating a personal balance sheet to track your net worth.  This is something I discussed with my mentor today.  He made an excellent point that how can you have a net worth goal if you aren&#8217;t going to measure it?  I may post more about this in the near future.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here are my three tasks for the day:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;ve done this not only today, but every day of the challenge: putting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_tags">meta keywords and descriptions</a> into every post by hand.  Brandon wrote in and reminded me of it.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><blockquote><p>Message:
   Hey Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve been following your 30 day challenge and besides the great information found there, I also noticed something completely unrelated: you&#8217;ve managed to include Meta Keywords and Titles for each individual post!</p>

<p>How exactly did you pull this off? Is there a plugin of some sort that can accomplish this?</p>

<p>If you could let me know, that would be an excellent feature to add to my blog at <a href="http://www.fitbuff.com">http://www.fitbuff.com</a></p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Brandon</p></blockquote>

<p>Check out my reply:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Brandon,</p></blockquote>

<p>Sure, I&#8217;m using a few plugins</p>

<p>Ultimate Tag Warrior (for the meta keywords)
<a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior">http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior</a></p>

<p>SEO Title Tag (for the titles):
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-title-tag/#post-808">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-title-tag/#post-808</a></p>

<p>and MetaTagz (for the description):
<a href="http://www.brandonbuttars.com/2007/03/29/wordpress-meta-tags-plugin/">http://www.brandonbuttars.com/2007/03/29/wordpress-meta-tags-plugin/</a></p>

<p>Seems like overkill, but I was using something called <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in one SEO</a>
in the past which didn&#8217;t do each one quite as well.</p>

<p>Good luck!
Brian</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I wrote and sent my article on <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/why-people-hate-cell-phone-companies/">Why People Hate Cell Phone Companies</a> to <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, because it falls directly in line with his type of thinking.  Hopefully he will get a kick out of it (and may link to it).  Something tells me that this is the type of article that could get picked up on sites like Digg.com and StumbleUpon.com given it&#8217;s wide appeal.</p></li>
<li><p>I sent a screen shot to the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">37 Signals Blog</a> for their &#8220;Screen Around Town&#8221; pages.  Interestingly I sent these in the past without any intention of getting back links (<a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/481-screens-around-town-xbox-sharp-and-r-mail">here</a> and <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/399-screens-around-town-clickbank-commerce-bank-freshbooks">here</a> are examples) because I&#8217;ve always been interested in user interface design.  However, they linked to me as a favor when I sent them the last one, so I&#8217;ve continued to send them.  Getting a link from the Signal vs. Noise blog carries a lot of weight (it is a Google <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Page Rank</a> 7 site) assuming you get on the home page.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Here is what I sent them:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Jason,</p></blockquote>

<p>This dialog in Firefox frustrates me.  I don&#8217;t know if I typed in the correct login and password, and whether it&#8217;s worth saving my best guess.</p>

<p>If I tell Firefox to remember it, and I turn out to be wrong (or have made a typo), there is a lengthy process now to track down the incorrect login and password in the security settings and remove it. Otherwise it will bring back my mistake to taunt me every time I see the page.</p>

<p>This could all be solved by showing the dialog one screen later.  Once the next page loads, I&#8217;ll know if my login was a success or failure, and whether it&#8217;s worth saving.</p>

<p>Brian Armstrong http://www.startbreakingfree.com/</p>

<p>P.S. thanks for including my link!  Unexpected perk.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/firefoxdialog1.png" alt="Firefox Dialog To Remember Passwords" /></p>

<p>They enjoy this type of content for their blog, so I&#8217;m just helping them out in exchange for a link.</p>

<p>If you are following along with these steps to apply it to your own website, you probably shouldn&#8217;t copy this step exactly.  But you can apply the principle.  Go to Technorati and find a <a href="http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/">popular blog</a> that interests you.  Submit useful links, tips, or tricks to them and you may get a back link (but don&#8217;t ask for it).</p>

<p>Here are just a few examples of where they went wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Having two year contracts, and extending them at every opportunity.  If you have to threaten your customers to keep them from leaving, you&#8217;ve got a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Sending customers outrageously large bills when they use too many minutes.  Why would you want to punish the people who are using your service the most?  They should automatically upgrade you to the next plan, or call/text you to let you know you&#8217;re at your limit.</p></li>
<li><p>Having way to many service plans, features, and line items on the bill.  My last bill had no fewer than 12 line items on it, many of them taxes and fees that I couldn&#8217;t explain the purpose of. (Note: Apple, a company that understands this, tried to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.37signals.com%2Fsvn%2Fposts%2F496-fly-on-the-wall-youtube-commenters-iphone-service-plans-ups&amp;ei=rsmPRpixIJvEqQLP8LXWDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCbfWtsTr-dKaB23pDZq5jG4Aiiw&amp;sig2=Ulbf1934qz8_01OKgs7aZQ">fix this</a> with the iPhone.)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Each one of these features was probably designed by a well meaning MBA or consultant who did a detailed analysis of how it would improve the bottom line.  And they were probably right.  Using a two year contract probably DOES improve the bottom line by selling more phones up front (you get the phone cheaper since it&#8217;s being paid off over time).</p>

<p>But the problem is that the consumer doesn&#8217;t CARE about T-Mobile, AT&T;, or Verizon&#8217;s bottom line.  All they know is that they felt angry the last time they were locked into a plan, used too many minutes, or saw a &#8220;Regulatory Programs Fee&#8221; on their bill.</p>

<p>Did the cell phone companies really need the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/NumberPortability/">government</a> to step in and tell them they should let their customers keep their phone number when switching?  It seems like a no brainer to me.  If you can provide additional value to your customers with hardly any additional work, maybe you should do it.</p>

<p>Trust your customers and treat them with respect, and they will reward you with far more business in the long term.</p>

<p>Cell phone companies are winning the battle and losing the war with this type of short term thinking, and it&#8217;s time they woke up.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/alexa-traffic-shopping-sites1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/alexa-traffic-shopping-sites1-150x150.png" alt="Alexa Comparison of Shopping Websites" /></a>Today is day 19 of my 30 day challenge to bring more readers to this website, increase the number of RSS subscribers, and sell more books.  This is part of a live demonstration I&#8217;m doing to show that blogging can be a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">profitable and inexpensive business that anyone can start</a>.</p>

<p>My three tasks for the day were&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?r=1&amp;ean=9781430307877">book finally appeared on Barnes &amp; Noble&#8217;s website</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t look quite right yet.  I spent some time sending them higher resolution cover images (front &amp; back) and some changes to the text.  It needs a little cleaning up before prime time.  It should also appear on Amazon.com relatively soon.</p></li>
<li><p>I added the book to <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/1035208/D9298999708278065731">Froogle</a>, Googles product directory.  Strangely, the listing will only last for 30 days as a maximum.  I guess they expect retailers to continually list their products.</p></li>
<li><p>I added the book to <a href="http://www.shopping.com/">Shopping.com&#8217;s directory</a>, which also feeds sites like <a href="http://www.mysimon.com">MySimon</a>.  Of the various shopping comparison sites, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=bizrate.com&amp;site1=shopping.com&amp;site2=mysimon.com&amp;site3=pricegrabber.com&amp;site4=&amp;y=p&amp;z=1&amp;h=300&amp;w=610&amp;range=3m&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=gigglesugar.com">Shopping.com seems to be the most popular</a>.  This listing was not free, and costs $0.15 per click that they drive to this website.  I&#8217;m funding the account with $50 so it will drive 333 visitors, and I&#8217;ll track how many end up buying.  To break even, 3 or 4 of those people (about 1%) will have to buy the book.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By the way, one non-marketing thing that I did today was open a separate business account for this website at Washington Mutual (they have great free business checking accounts).  This will help me track all my income and expenses from this blog.  This is something I recommend all entrepreneurs do when starting a new project.  Just using the debit card for your business account will automatically track all your business expenses for tax time (so you can deduct them!).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I wrote a new article for LifeHack.org.  I&#8217;ll post a link when it comes out in a few days.</p></li>
<li><p>I contacted Scott Allen at <a href="http://entrepreneurs.about.com">About.com&#8217;s Entrepreneur Section</a> to see if there was an opportunity to work together.  His <a href="http://entrepreneurs.about.com/b/a/216405.htm">interview style</a> is refreshing.</p></li>
<li><p>I put Breaking Free and StartBreakingFree.com on my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/barmstrong">linked in</a> profile.</p></li>

<p>My three tasks for today were:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I spent the morning getting the audio recording of the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-16-engaging-readers-in-conversation-interview-on-calling-all-authors-and-a-research-tip-from-john-reese/">author interview</a> put on the website.  This will be a great way for people get an overview of the website and my philosophy on starting a business in an audio format, and will make the site more sticky.  Check for it a little bit later today.</p></li>
<li><p>I spoke with 1and1 and they finally transfered this site to a new shared server.  I&#8217;ve noticed it loading much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>I created some business cards for this website in Photoshop, and ordered them through <a href="http://www.48hourprint.com">48HourPrint.com</a>.  It cost me $66.92 (including shipping) for 500 cards. (see photo)</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to give you a preview of whats to come on this site&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;ll be releasing a product in the next few months I&#8217;m calling &#8220;Interviews with Self-Made Millionaires&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been finding and meeting people who have actually done it&#8230;.quit their job, started their own business, and are now worth in excess of $1 Million (and in some cases $50 million or more).</li>
</ol>


<p>In the interviews they&#8217;ll be sharing how they did, the secrets to their success, and where they made mistakes along the way.  I&#8217;ve done two of them so far, but I&#8217;m not quite ready to release it.  It will probably be a subscription product where for about $20/month you can get a new interview each month as a CD mailed to your house or as an MP3 download to put on your iPod.</p>

<p>I am REALLY excited about this for a lot of reasons.  In terms of the potential to really help people, I think it could be the best product available anywhere to learn entrepreneurship and wealth building.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After I complete the 30 day marketing challenge, I&#8217;d like to do another article series, but this one will be a 30 day challenge to start a business for less than $100 and get my first customer.  It will be a live demonstration of sorts.  Also another great project that I think people will get a lot of value out of&#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;d like to create a page on this website that contains a list of successful companies which have been started for under $100.  It will be a hall-of-fame that will list annual revenues of each company and some info about their founders.  This could be a big inspiration to anyone who needs a reminder that &#8220;yes, it really is possible, if they&#8217;re doing it I can too&#8221;.</p></li>
</ol>
