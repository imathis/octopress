  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember a few days ago when I <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-get-a-good-mentor/">told you</a> about the 23 year old millionaire, Neil Patel, who I called for advice?</p>

<p>Well it looks like he&#8217;s joined a group of other entrepreneurs for an online class that you might want to checkout.  It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.onlineprofits.com/36.html">Online Profits</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.onlineprofits.com/36.html"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/01/picture-31.png" alt="" /></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have some interesting insights into business, entrepreneurship, real estate, marketing, passive income, etc - then I’d like to hear from you!</p>

<p>Up until now - StartBreakingFree.com has largely been about posting my thoughts.  I get some interaction with the readers in the comments, but I&#8217;d like more.  I know there are tons of experienced entrepreneurs who read this blog on a regular basis and you (the readers) deserve to get the benefit of their wisdom and experience too!</p>

<p>So as of today I&#8217;m accepting applicants for contributing authors to StartBreakingFree.com who would be able to post to this blog about once a week or every other week.  Length of the article is not a primary concern (they can even be as short as one paragraph if that’s all you need - often being concise is better).  What is of primary concern is that the content is original and the advice useful!</p>

<p>Good topics would include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Challenges you are facing in your own business</p></li>
<li><p>How you faced and overcame those challenges</p></li>
<li><p>What&#8217;s working well for you in business and what isn&#8217;t</p></li>
<li><p>Exciting new trends that you think others should be aware of</p></li>
<li><p>Business ideas that you think have great potential - but perhaps you don&#8217;t have time to pursue personally</p></li>
<li><p>Lifestyles topics on the benefits of breaking free</p></li>
<li><p>Many more&#8230;</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The site has grown rapidly in recent months and we now have more than 2,250 daily readers.  As a contributing author you are welcome to include a short “about the author” section at the bottom of your posts which can include a link of your choice (for example, if you have a related business or personal blog).  This can be a great way to send some qualified traffic your way.</p>

<p>Also, just to be clear this does NOT mean I will personally stop making posts.  I will still be writing my own articles as well - but adding a few more authors will hopefully allow you the reader to get some additional insight from other entrepreneurs.</p>

<p><strong>To apply please email me at “brian at startbreakingfree dotcom” and tell me briefly (in no more than a few sentences) why you’d like to contribute and how you can bring a unique perspective.</strong>  Real world experience and business success is a plus.  Feel free to include any writing samples if you have some handy and I’ll get back to you ASAP.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Marcus Frind created a free online dating website called <a href="http://www.plentyoffish.com/">PlentyOfFish.com</a>.  It serves up 1.6 billion pages views each month yet Marcus is the only employee, he works about one hour per day, and the website brings in about $10 million per year.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20090101/and-the-money-comes-rolling-in_Printer_Friendly.html">this excellent Inc Magazine article</a> Marcus sums up his idea of a great business model:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pick a market in which the competition charges money for its service, build a lean operation with a &#8220;dead simple&#8221; free website, and pay for it using Google AdSense.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is basically the ad supported business model which requires lots of page views but can work.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum we have 37Signals who also has a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">multi-million dollar per year suite of products</a> which people pay monthly subscriptions to use.</p>

<p>Here is founder David Heinemeier Hansson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1366-a-radical-idea-charge-people-for-your-product">view on a great business model</a> which actually charges money instead of relying on ad-revenue:</p>

<blockquote><p>You have customers, they pay you money for the product or service, and you get profits! It’s almost too simple to work. Of course, 37signals didn’t come up with this idea on its own, either: I’ve heard that over time—hundreds of years actually—this has been how most businesses have made their money. But somehow that notion got lost in the Web world&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>  Web entrepreneurs would be better off starting their businesses in the way most offline entrepreneurs do: Use a small amount of seed capital to make a good product that appeals to a client base that is willing to pay you for it. Then, over time, use the money you make from your customers to improve the product or to create more products—allowing you to attract more paying customers, which then lets you invest more into the business, and so on.</p>

<p>So which is better - a paid website or a free/ad-supported website?</p>

<p>I think both models make sense.  You have to look at how much value your site is really contributing to people&#8217;s lives.  If you are helping them earn a living or save money, or performing a critical business task - then yes people will probably pay for it and you have a good business model to charge for.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, if your website is a novelty, entertainment, or more fun for people than it is essential, or if you are trying to beat an incumbent who is already doing the pay model successfully - then maybe you have a good candidate for a free, ad-supported, website.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/">Neil Patel</a>, put up an interesting post on his blog today about his mentor.  He also generously offered to give his own time in case anyone had questions.</p>

<p>As you may know, I&#8217;m very big on finding good mentors (especially people who are successful and have <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-worst-mistake-you-can-make-when-asking-for-advice/">already done what I&#8217;m trying to accomplish</a>).</p>

<p>Well, Neil fits the bill.  At the ripe old age of 23 he is a very successful entrepreneur and a millionaire from several web businesses he&#8217;s started (I&#8217;m assuming this based on his <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/about/#neilpatel">very interesting life story</a> where he talks about losing a million dollars on a single investment).  He started <a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/">Crazy Egg</a> and several other web companies you may be familiar with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/about/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/01/neilpatel1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Anyway after reading his <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2009/01/06/looking-for-a-mentor-why-not-use-mine/">blog post on mentors</a> I decided to give Neil a call and get his feedback on my current project: <a href="http://www.UniversityTutor.com">www.UniversityTutor.com</a>.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I got right through to him.  His first reaction about my business?  Get involved in online tutoring and change the business model to take a cut of each hour instead of a monthly fee.  I&#8217;m still trying to work out exactly how this might work and I&#8217;ve been researching online tutoring today, but what do you think?  If you have any experience with online tutoring and best practices please leave a comment below.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: the key to finding good mentors is simple but no one does it - just ask!  You&#8217;d be surprised how accessible some people are and in my experience successful people are usually happy to help.</p>

<p>Second lesson: try to give back in any way you can.  How will I do that?  By asking you to do yourself a favor and go <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/">subscribe to Neil&#8217;s blog</a>.  It&#8217;s quite good.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!
Brian Armstrong</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Want to make sure you accomplish your goals in 2009?  Well <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/productivity">Eben Pagan</a> has a new video out that is pretty good.</p>

<p>Eben is a very impressive entrepreneur who has built several multi-million dollar companies.  I&#8217;ve listened and read probably about 100 hours of his material.  Some of them three or four times.</p>

<p>Click play to watch hist latest video below.  You can enter your email to watch the second part if you&#8217;d like which has the good stuff (it&#8217;s free).</p>

<p><strong>Check out his latest video:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/productivity"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/01/wakeupproductive1.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Some of the best take aways I&#8217;ve gotten from this type of thinking are to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Work for uninterrupted periods of at least 1.5 hours.  I now ROUTINELY turn off my phone and email while working which is something I never did before.</p></li>
<li><p>I have uninstalled ALL chat programs and turned off Google Chat within Gmail unless I have a specific meeting with someone.  Interruptions are the #1 enemy (watch the video to find out why).</p></li>
<li><p>I keep a paper todo list at all time on the right side of my computer and each day I pick the single most important task to get done for the day and try to do it FIRST.</p></li>
<li><p>I pick a task that will actually get me the best results and progress in my business - whereas before I would often pick the easiest or quickest task first.  I now routinely ask myself a very important question: Am I being busy right now or productive?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This type of stuff has been great for me and allowed me to get a lot more done in 2008 when I read through it.  If I had to make a list of the business mentors I look up to the most - Eben Pagan would honestly be in the top five.  As I said above I&#8217;ve listened or read through literally a ton of his stuff (some of it multiple times).</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/productivity">check out the video here</a> and enter you email to get the 2nd part.  His Wake Up Productive program isn&#8217;t cheap but he gives away a ton of really good advice for free even if you don&#8217;t want to buy it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My one goal in 2008 (or new years resolution if you&#8217;d like) was to get to $2,000 per month in passive income.  There was hardly a day that went by in 2008 that I didn&#8217;t think about this goal actually.  I was that obsessed with it.</p>

<p>By the way, in case you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;$2,000 doesn&#8217;t sound like very much income per month&#8221;, keep in mind that this is PASSIVE income - income that comes in whether I work or not.  In other words, this income cannot come from any hourly or regular &#8220;job&#8221; type work.  It comes from things like real estate rental income, businesses you&#8217;ve setup that are running on autopilot, investment income like dividends, royalties from books or products being sold, etc.  I was also earning other income during this time from my existing business and consulting which DID require my time and wasn&#8217;t passive.</p>

<p>If you are curious why passive income is such a big goal of mine you can read <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-get-rich/">this</a> and <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-the-rich-think-differently-than-the-poor-and-middle-class/">this</a> for some background, but essentially it boils down to this: if you no longer have to trade your time for money you have truly broken free and can start to accomplish great things in life.</p>

<p><strong>Real Estate</strong></p>

<p>To be clear, my goal as originally <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-single-most-important-thing-to-do-in-2008/">written on this blog December 16th, 2007</a> was to get to $2,000 per month in passive income VIA REAL ESTATE specifically.  At that time I was convinced this was going to be my best path.</p>

<p>The year started out with a bang and in January I closed on 2 rental properties (the process to buy them had been in the works before this).  Things seemed to be going along fine - I had actually purchased 5 properties total in the last year and while some of them <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-a-good-real-estate-deal-turns-into-a-bad-one/">didn&#8217;t</a> <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/brian-goes-to-court-brings-home-the-bacon/">turn out</a> so well, <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-i-made-a-113-return-in-one-month-with-real-estate/">others did</a>.</p>

<p>After a court battle with an unscrupulous contractor and dealing with an incompetent/immoral mortgage broker, real estate was beginning to take it&#8217;s toll on me stress wise.  By this time it was already mid-year and I was not on track to get enough property to accomplish my goal by years end.  I was ready to keep pushing on, but at this time the mortgage market dried up (especially for self employed people like myself) which meant the deals kept getting better but I could not get financing to buy any of them.</p>

<p>It was time to re-evaluate my goal.  I had 3 properties rented out and cash flowing (with only about $250 per month in passive income after all expenses - I had hoped it would be more) but I was unable to buy more and I wasn&#8217;t close to accomplishing my goal.  It was time to &#8220;adjust&#8221; my goal to find another way.  Remember, if you want something bad enough there is always another way.</p>

<p><strong>The Blog</strong></p>

<p>Around this time I noticed that this blog had started to pull in some <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/blog-income-report-august-2008/">decent money</a>.  it wasn&#8217;t much yet but it had potential.  This got me excited enough to try some other monetization efforts, continue writing, and eventually <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-i-reached-2000-subscribers-on-this-blog/">break the 2,000 subscriber mark</a>.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve often said about blogging, pick something you love writing about because for the first year it will feel like nobody is reading it.  But if you can get through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841666?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591841666">The Dip</a>, then you can wake up with a nice passive income business in a few years.</p>

<p>By the way, blogging isn&#8217;t as passive as some other forms, but I still consider it to be quite passive for two reasons: (1) I&#8217;d probably do it whether I got money from it or not and (2) when your blog becomes successful your compensation is not tied to the number of hours you put in like a traditional job.</p>

<p>Anyway, the blog began to contribute to my passive income slowly and steadily at this time until it was generating about $400 per month.  I was firing on two cylinders now - real estate and blogging - but I felt like I needed to add one more to accomplish my goal in time.  The year was running out!</p>

<p><strong>Launching The Tutoring Site</strong></p>

<p>Luckily, earlier in the year I had launched a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">passive income business as a test</a>.  This site matched tutors with students who needed help.</p>

<p>I had <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-evolution-of-a-business-model-never-stop-testing/">experimented</a> with all sorts of business models and finally got one with some potential.  It was starting to generate about $300 dollars per month, but at this point it was getting quite late in the year.</p>

<p><strong>So how close did I get?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I just finished putting together my financial statements for December 2008.  By the way, if you aren&#8217;t looking at your personal and business financial statements monthly you probably should be.  This is one of the best things I ever did to start accomplishing financial goals - a very wealthy mentor got me to start doing it and it&#8217;s really helped.  After all, how can you know if you&#8217;re accomplishing something unless you measure it?  <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-and-create-a-personal-financial-statement-each-month-in-5-minutes/">Here&#8217;s an easy way to do it yourself</a> if you don&#8217;t have an accountant (I do them myself too).</p>

<p>Anyway, here is how it broke down:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$250.00 - Real Estate Rental Income (after taking out principal, interest, taxes, insurance, HOA dues, etc - this is true cash flow)</p></li>
<li><p>$1,260.40 - this blog, StartBreakingFree.com from book sales, ads, affiliate commissions, etc</p></li>
<li><p>$129.20 - the tutoring site (after large advertising expenses for the month and a software glitch)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>TOTAL: $1,649.60</p>

<p>The real estate income was predictable.</p>

<p>The blog was a big surprise.  At the start of 2008 I would not have guessed this would have grown like it did.  I should also mention that during December there was higher than normal <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">book sales</a> and affiliate commissions (although lower ad revenue due to decreased traffic during the holidays).  December was the blog&#8217;s most profitable month ever.</p>

<p>The tutoring site was the greatest disappointment for me.  I thought it would completely out-earn the blog, not the other way around.  There are two big reasons why the passive income it generated was low for December: (1) I had quite high advertising expenses to drive in new tutors that month, which was an investment in the business but hurt the cash flow and (2) it was suffering from a rather large bug in the software which caused much of the communication on the site to fail.  After getting complaints for several months from people using the site, I was FINALLY able to track down what was happening and it is now fixed.  (In case you are curious and a geek like me, the reverse DNS on my server was set incorrectly caused a large number of my outgoing emails to be marked as spam).</p>

<p>This was incredibly frustrating because I lost a bunch of paying customers and some people left in frustration.  But it is also exciting, because now that the bug is fixed I can see what this baby can really do!  I still have big hopes for it - and the number of users plus traffic to the site continue to grow quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Passive income is a funny thing because it requires a disproportionate amount of really hard work up front for very little compensation - and I felt like that was this year for me in some ways.  But I&#8217;ve laid the foundation for success and now that I&#8217;ve gotten the flywheel turning just a little bit, it won&#8217;t take much effort to have it REALLY humming in 2009.</p>

<p>The blog and tutoring site will continue to grow at an increasing pace with little additional effort on my part - they are great assets.  I&#8217;m still fond of real estate as an investment vehicle and will be open to buying more as the lending markets change.  I would especially like to invest in a partnership to buy an apartment complex (with the right investor) at some point in the future but financially that is a ways off.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m happy with getting 82% of the way toward my yearly goal ($1,649 out of $2,000).  I&#8217;ve read before that you&#8217;re goals should be ambitious enough that they really push you while at the same time being believable.  Put another way, you should have about a 50% chance of achieving it.  By that measure I&#8217;d say I was spot on.</p>

<p>And since I&#8217;m big on PUBLICLY writing my goals, and it worked so well in 2008, here is my goal for 2009: reach $5,000 per month in totally passive income.</p>

<p>I estimate that by the time I reach about $3,000 per month in passive income, I can probably stop doing all other types of earned income and I will effectively be retired at the age of 26 since I will no longer HAVE to work for money.  Of course, I still will be working on all sorts of interesting projects - that&#8217;s just my nature - but I&#8217;ll be able to choose them because I want to not because I need the money.  And that&#8217;s a very powerful place to be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One cool thing I got to do over the break was meet with Erica Douglass.  We met through a mutual friend and when she saw that I was <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-make-the-holidays-less-stressful/">heading to San Jose</a> she asked if I wanted to meet up.  I&#8217;m really glad she did because I always enjoy meeting more experienced entrepreneurs - and her story is pretty interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/n3002642_31824529_93441.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/n3002642_31824529_93441.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>She moved to San Jose from Indiana back in 1999 - and went through a series of internet businesses ultimately culminating in selling her web hosting business for $1.1 million.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting things she told me was that a few years before she sold the business she was seeking financing from a number of different investors and they all told her &#8220;no - it&#8217;s just another hosting company&#8221;.  But around early 2007 - when she didn&#8217;t need financing any longer - the opposite started happening and investors started approaching HER with offers to invest.  She figured that if things were this crazy that you didn&#8217;t even have to ask for money anymore, then the market must have peaked.  If things were this irrational then the bubble was about to burst!  She decided to get out and sell her business - timing the peak of the market by just 3 weeks.  This really stuck with me as good advice.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="http://www.erica.biz/about-erica/">Erica&#8217;s story here</a> and I suggest you <a href="http://www.erica.biz/">check out her blog</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s New Book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017922?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316017922">Outliers</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017922?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316017922"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-111.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I got this book for Christmas and couldn&#8217;t put it down.  It was very impressive, the basic message being:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Success is often due to timing, luck, and opportunities beyond our control - and is not as much due to IQ, getting into a good school, and other factors we typically associate with success.</p></li>
<li><p>10,000 hours practice, however, does seems to be pre-requisite for mastering any skill - overnight successes, prodigies, etc are commonly portrayed in stories and the media but don&#8217;t really exist</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For example, they looked at a group of violin players in a music school and broke them into 3 categories (A, B, and C) based on how good they were.  As it turned out, the number of hours they practiced perfectly correlated to what group they were in (with the A group all having practiced over 10,000 hours).  Perhaps this wouldn&#8217;t be too surprising until they saw that there were no &#8220;prodigies&#8221; in the A group - people who were so gifted they managed to sneak into the A group without putting in the 10,000 hours.  It just didn&#8217;t happen - there wasn&#8217;t a single one.  Similarly, there wasn&#8217;t anyone with MORE than 10,000 hours of practice who DIDN&#8217;T make the A group.  Not a single one.</p>

<p>That was just one study but the same affect isn&#8217;t just for violin.  The same holds true for software billionaires, hockey players, the Beatles, etc.  Gladwell&#8217;s arguments in the book aren&#8217;t always scientifically rigorous - it&#8217;s meant to be more of an entertaining read - but he cites the sources at the end of the book and it appears to be well researched.</p>

<p>The implications of this are staggering: if you have at least a base level of intelligence or talent, the ONLY factor which determines your success is if you are willing to put in the time and effort to become great.  This is similar to a great book I read a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/writing-less-is-better-and-harder-than-writing-more/">little while back</a>, Seth Godin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841666?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591841666">The Dip</a>, which I also highly recommend.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017922?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316017922">Outlier&#8217;s on Amazon.com</a> if you want to read it.</p>

<p><strong>What are you willing to work 10,000 hours on?</strong></p>

<p>It got me thinking: 10,000 hours is a lot.  It works out to about 3 or 4 hours per day five days a week for 10 years.  What am I passionate enough about that I&#8217;ve either already put in this time or would be willing to do so?  I do a lot of hobby type activities (acting, martial arts, etc) which I enjoy but would never be willing to put that much time into.  However, almost every day since I was about 13 I&#8217;ve been working late into the night learning to program computers and build online businesses (easily 3-4 hours per day 5 days a week).  Thirteen was about when I started my first online business and I was tinkering around with it even before that.  I feel like I have a wide body of knowledge around the subject, perhaps even a mastery of it.  Certainly not the best in the world though.  I am still constantly awed by work that a handful of other people are doing in this area - but not many.</p>

<p>I really like this concept because everyone is looking for a get rich quick scheme and it doesn&#8217;t exist.  The secret to success is simple, but not easy: find something you love so much that you are willing to spend 10,000 hours learning it.  You have to want it THAT BADLY, whatever it is - you can&#8217;t get bored and give up in six months (or even six years).  When you look at it like that, then working for a year on a big project and totally failing doesn&#8217;t seem that bad.  It takes most people 10 years.</p>

<p>A few other things: thanks to Cori for letting me know that my article <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/8-essential-skills-they-didnt-teach-you-in-school.html">8 Essential Skills They Didn’t Teach You In School </a> got rated the <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-80-best-lifehacks-of-2008.html">#1 Success/Achievement Article of 2008 on LifeHack.org</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, using your blog to build your brand works!  A few weeks ago I got interviewed on a Dublin talk radio station.  This brought in some new subscribers and I sold a bunch of books.  They found me through my blog.</p>

<p>Finally, in the next few days I&#8217;ll be posting about my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-single-most-important-thing-to-do-in-2008/">2008 new years resolution</a> to get $2,000 per month in passive income (did I achieve it? :).  I&#8217;ll also be posting about my goals for 2009.  Hopefully you have a few in mind as well!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just moments ago I was sitting in an airport waiting to come home to San Jose, California for the holidays.  Lo and behold - they came on the loudspeaker and announced that our flight had been cancelled.  Not delayed, but CANCELLED cancelled, as in not going anywhere for at least a day.</p>

<p>Everyone immediately started complaining.  A number of people start cursing loudly on their cell phones and yelling at the airline employees.  It was truly incredible to see such a large group of adults totally lose it and overreact.</p>

<p>I happened to be sitting there in a zen like state eating a candy bar and listening to an audio book at the moment - and I can honestly say it didn&#8217;t bother me one bit.  In fact, I was almost laughing to myself at how funny it was watching everyone.  I mean sure, maybe it&#8217;s not what you were expecting - but would it really be the end of the world if you got there one day later?  It reminded me of a popular article I wrote on this blog about <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-stop-letting-little-things-in-life-piss-you-off/">why you shouldn&#8217;t let little things in piss you off</a>.</p>

Delayed/cancelled flights - photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/presta/">presta</a></p>

<p>I even had the presence of mind to snap a few pictures to document the occasion.  Honestly, I felt a bit like a researcher observing a bunch of monkeys who had just gotten their cocaine pellets taken away.  I started feeling bad for the airline employees though.  People were making all sorts of jokes at their expense and yelling at them (the irony of course was that the airline employees had nothing to do with the flight being cancelled - they were merely the bearers of bad news).</p>

<p>The two or three overworked employees at the gate started frantically dealing with all the angry customers to book them in a hotel for the night and reschedule their flights.  It seemed no one was getting to California until tomorrow as this was one of the last flights of the day.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s when I got an idea.  I knew my parents were up in San Francisco for the day (which is about an hour from San Jose) and might be able to pick me up there.  I waited through the line of angry people to get to the ticket counter and finally came up to the attractive checker who looked like she was about at her wits end.</p>

<p>I gave her a big smile and said &#8220;by the way I can tell you guys are doing your best here and this isn&#8217;t your fault - so don&#8217;t let these silly people get to you&#8221;.  She immediately looked up and smiled as if to say &#8220;wow, I can&#8217;t believe you just said that&#8221;.  I held eye contact with her for a bit and flirted as I continued&#8230;&#8221;by the way, if it helps I totally wouldn&#8217;t mind going to San Francisco instead, just thought I&#8217;d offer&#8221;. (Another big smile).</p>

<p>She laughed for a moment and started searching flights.  Moments later I was booked on a standby ticket to San Francisco.  Then I helped her with another customer who didn&#8217;t speak English very well.  As I walked away, ticket in hand, a few people eyed me suspiciously with a look that said &#8220;wait a sec&#8230;how&#8217;d HE get a another flight already&#8221;.  &#8220;By not being an asshole!&#8221; I thought to myself.</p>

<p>After getting my standby ticket I had a few hours to kill.  Instead of hanging around the angry mob, I retired to the airport bar for some cocktails.  If you want to meet people who also have the &#8220;just-freakin-relax!&#8221; attitude toward flying you should checkout the airport bar.  I regaled stories with other stranded passengers about their world travels and even helped the bartender get a date while I was there.  You never know who you&#8217;ll meet in these places; airports are full of interesting people.</p>

<p>Anyway, long story short&#8230;that huge angry mob of customers was crowded around the ticket counter for a solid two hours and was finally carted off (kicking and screaming) to a nearby hotel for the night.  They won&#8217;t be making it to California tonight while I, on the other hand, am currently typing this article from 30,000 feet up on my way to San Francisco.  Success!</p>

Me blogging on an airplane - the people next to me probably thought I was pretty weird</p>

<p>I realized also while writing this just how far I&#8217;ve come in the last few years since quitting my job in 2005.  Working for myself has improved my quality of life in so many ways.  I&#8217;ve become independent.  I feel like things don&#8217;t bother me as much anymore.  I&#8217;m not stressed about little things.  I just know everything is going to be OK because I&#8217;m in control of my life - I control my own destiny and I know I&#8217;ll be OK no matter what happens.  I know that even if I didn&#8217;t make it to California until tomorrow I still would have been fine.  It would have made an interesting story for the family at Christmas and I would have probably gotten into some other fun adventure.  If you just have the mindset that you&#8217;re on vacation already, you can start having fun right away - even if you&#8217;re stuck in the airport bar or if you&#8217;re in the totally wrong city (probably more so if you&#8217;re in the wrong city).</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are still some things I have to work on.  I get sad sometimes, I get angry at people who I feel have wronged me, I sometimes replay negative thoughts or conversations in my head even though I know it serves no purpose.  But overall my life is just much easier and more fun and much more relaxing now that I&#8217;m self employed and have started generate more passive income.  This feeling I can really only attribute to the complete freedom that comes with being my own boss and setting all my own rules in life.  I know that I&#8217;m the only one responsible whether I fail or succeed.  I&#8217;ve really <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">broken free</a> - and it&#8217;s a great spot to be.</p>

<p>I hope you&#8217;re making the best of the holidays - no matter where you might be or what situation you might be in.  Have fun!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a somewhat funny experience today discovering how computers figure out what is spam and what is not.</p>

<p>It started when I got an email from a new customer on <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com/">my tutoring site</a> (this is a passive income business I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">working on</a>).</p>

<blockquote><p>Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>This got marked as Spam, just so you know. I just happened to catch it while browsing for a FR33 D0NG-B00ST WITH M3XICAN V1AGRA!!!
Don&#8217;t know why this got blocked when none of the student contacts did, but you might wanna check it out. Meanwhile I&#8217;ll subscribe; I been clockin mad cheddar from this shit.

<p>After contemplating whether or not to add his quote &#8220;I been clockin mad cheddar from this shit&#8221; to my testimonial page, I decided to investigate why my email might be getting marked as spam.</p>

<p>After all, this was a pretty important email.  It was the email where I ask tutors (with a free account) to subscribe and pay me money after their free trial has ended.  It&#8217;s the moment of truth where I find out if people really think my service is worth paying for.  This needed to be fixed ASAP!</p>

<p>Here is what the email looked like that was getting marked as spam (with html links and image removed):</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi [first name],</p></blockquote>

<p>We hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed using UniversityTutor.com. Five students have now contacted you (which is the max for a free account) and hopefully at least one of those has turned into a tutoring job for you!</p>

<p>Now would be a great time to subscribe if you&#8217;d like to continue getting matched with students and making money tutoring. Keep in mind that the real benefit comes over time as you build your experience and client ratings on the site. If you already have a couple students you&#8217;re working with, it might be time to raise your prices!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to get&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlimited contacts from students looking to hire you</li>
<li>Unlimited client ratings and reviews so you can build your experience and raise your hourly rate</li>
<li>As always, keep 100% of what you earn and set your own price</li>
<li>Work WHEN and WHERE you want with flexible hours and locations</li>
<li>Try it risk-free with our 60 day money back guarantee!</li>
</ul>


<p>Subscriptions are month-to-month and it&#8217;s easy to cancel or pause your subscription at any time. There is no setup fee, no early termination fee, and no long term contracts.</p>

<p>With an ongoing stream of tutoring jobs, you can earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month, but a subscription to UniversityTutor.com is just $9.95/month for a limited time. It pays for itself with less than one hour of tutoring!</p>

<p>Best of all, you can try it absolutely risk-free. Here is our promise: if you are not completely satisfied, contact us any time within 60 days for a full, no-hassle refund.</p>

<p>Click here to subscribe and continue earning money tutoring. It takes just a few seconds:</p>

<p>One tool you can use to analyze the &#8220;spam score&#8221; of a message is called Spam Assassin.  Luckily, my <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/awber">Aweber account</a> had a tool built into it that allowed me to check the spam score with Spam Assassin.  (If anyone knows a way to do this without Aweber please post a comment below).</p>

<p>Whoever wrote the tool had a sense of humor because this is the report it generated on my message.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-211.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-211.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Apparently it got a spam score of 4.9 out of 10, which isn&#8217;t terrible but it&#8217;s right on the border line of becoming spam.  I had to laugh a little when it told me my message was being marked as spam because it didn&#8217;t believe my claim of &#8220;risk free - suuurrreee&#8221; and that &#8220;something was being emphatically guaranteed&#8221;.</p>

<p>After reading the report, all I had to do was make two small changes.  Instead of saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>Try it risk-free with our 60 day money back guarantee!</p></blockquote>

<p>I changed it to:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you aren&#8217;t 100% satisfied, contact us any time within 60 days for a full, no-hassle refund</p></blockquote>

<p>And I removed the sentence which reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>Best of all, you can try it absolutely risk-free.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is my NEW spam score:</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-311.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-311.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I think I must have been reading too much internet marketing junk - because I realized that my original email did sound pretty over-hyped (and it still does probably).  Smart people don&#8217;t get tricked by gimmicky stuff like that - they just want an honest service that won&#8217;t screw them.</p>

<p>So anyway, hopefully more of my potential customers will be getting this email now.  If you don&#8217;t even ASK for the sale (because it&#8217;s in their spam folder) - you will never get it.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!
