  <div class="entry-content"><p>Check out this question from a Breaking Free reader&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I have been thinking about opening a coffee shop, not long actually probably for this past month, Im 21 years old and currently part of an internship. I have a lot of time to plan, and research, but I cant seem to grasp what exactly I need to do. The obvious would be taking a basic course in business, however, in the meantime… Do you have any suggestions on what I should start learning, if I am someday to own a coffee lounge? Books? Sites for people starting coffee shops? Anything you post is HIGHLY appreciated thanks…</p>

<p>Brimo Knight</p>

<p>Hi Brimo,</p>

<p>I have zero experience starting coffee shops, but I can tell you what I’d do if I wanted to learn how: find half a dozen local coffee shops that seem to be doing really well, and see if you can get a meeting with the owner.</p>

<p>Most business owners are willing to help if you approach it as a younger person who is eager to learn. Just tell them you are an aspiring entrepreneur and have no idea what you are doing, but want to see if you could get 10 minutes of their time and some advice. They’ll talk your ear off with all the challenges they’ve faced, some may try to talk you out of it, but it will all be valuable. If you happen to connect especially well with one of them, try to follow up with them on a regular basis and get them as as mentor.</p>

<p>Remember: the best way to be successful is to find someone who has already done it and do what they’re doing. Only after you have really mastered what they&#8217;re doing is it time to innovate - not in the beginning.</p>

<p>Also, be careful not to get advice from a coffee shop owner who is also doing it for the first time, almost bankrupt, or barely getting by. Obviously this is a delicate issue and you can’t ask them outright for their financial statements, so you’ll have to use your best judgment. Advice from a failing coffee shop owner could actually be worse than no advice at all. Find the people who have been doing it a long time, own multiple shops, and are actually successful at it.</p>

<p>At least that&#8217;s how I&#8217;d go about it - do any readers have experience opening coffee shops? Maybe you can leave your advice for Brimo in the comments.</p>

<p>Good luck, and keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a cool week. I&#8217;ve been reading this awesome book, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0887306667?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0887306667">22 Immutable Laws Of Marketing</a>. It&#8217;s short, simple, and profound. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>I also met up for drinks with another American entrepreneur living in Buenos Aires (found me through the blog). Turns out he started <a href="http://www.virtualdatingassistants.com/">http://www.virtualdatingassistants.com/</a> Check it out and let him know what you think :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve continued to improve UniversityTutor.com. It is now ready for an international audience. Tutors can list prices in any currency and subjects in their local jargon. People can search anywhere in the world now, and I&#8217;ve imported a database of 80,000 cities around the world so it will continue to generate search engine optimized pages in various cities.</p>

<p>Marketing has already started internationally. I&#8217;ll be targeting other English speaking countries first, specifically the UK, Australia, Canada, and India. Did you know India has the second largest English speaking population of any country in the world (after the U.S.)? I didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I think I can get 10,000 or 20,000 tutors signed up by the end of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Ideas On Improving BuyersVote.com</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also taken a bit of time to refine my thoughts on BuyersVote.com - and gotten some great ideas from other people over the last week which have helped, so thanks for that. If you&#8217;re reading this I&#8217;d like to get your input as well.</p>

<p>I like the basic concept of user generated online reviews in ANY category, but it needs some work.</p>

<p>Specifically, the mental barrier to creating a new page is too high. There are <a href="http://buyersvote.com/pages/new">too many fields to fill out</a> for one thing. As a first time visitor to the site, I think I&#8217;d like the concept, but probably wouldn&#8217;t take the plunge to actually create a new page.</p>

<p>This is part of the brilliance in the simplicity of Twitter. There is a very low mental barrier to posting because you KNOW it can&#8217;t be more than 140 characters. If it was an open ended text field (like a blog post) people would subconsciously avoid it.</p>

<p>Another thing I&#8217;ve been looking at it the relationship between &#8220;pages&#8221; and &#8220;categories&#8221;.</p>

<p>The site right now is designed around the idea of adding a <a href="http://buyersvote.com/pages/new">page</a>, then you give it some categories later.</p>

<p>But whenever I&#8217;ve found myself wanting to use the site (like &#8220;man I wish there was a list of the best XYZ out there&#8221;), I&#8217;ve always thought about it in terms of a category, not a page.</p>

<p>So I got around to doing some sketches on paper (this is the best method of website design for me at least). Let&#8217;s put on our user interface design caps for a moment.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/06/buyersvote1.jpg" alt="buyersvote1.jpg" /></p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>As you can see I&#8217;ve tried to make it based around adding a category instead of a page. You can add as many pages as you want under the category. The list of pages (or items) grows with some javascript similar to Google&#8217;s multiple choice forms if you&#8217;ve ever seen that, so you could add as many as you want there. You (or other people) could also add more after the category was created of course.</p>

<p>The &#8220;prove you&#8217;re human&#8221; is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">captcha</a> to prevent spam.</p>

<p>The home page could then be changed&#8230;maybe something like this with a search field, some currently popular categories (I like the idea of a homepage with changing content so people could start participating right away without actually creating anything), and most importantly a form to add a new category right on the home page?</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/06/buyersvote2.jpg" alt="buyersvote2.jpg" /></p>

<p>Is this a better direction to take?</p>

<p>Some further simplifications could be made on an actual category page as well. Maybe instead of letting people do 1-10 reviews and averaging them, I should just use a simple &#8220;vote up&#8221; &#8220;vote down&#8221; number that tracks the total number of votes.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/06/buyersvote3.jpg" alt="buyersvote3.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is a slightly less fair method of voting because it suffers from a time bias - older items which have been around a long time could have accumulated large numbers of votes, where a new page with a higher % of up votes could actually be ranked lower. But I can think of some ways around this, like showing only votes for the past year or month as an option, so it may be worth it for the simplicity.</p>

<p>Actual reviews on the item page could be limited to 140 characters like Twitter as well, the lower the mental barrier further.</p>

<p>One downside to this approach is that each category would keep separate lists of items, so a page could not belong to multiple categories.</p>

<p>Right now, iPhone could be under the cell phone category, a smart phone category, and a web enabled phones category. Reviews and votes from ALL categories would be averaged 1-10 for a single iPhone page.</p>

<p>But if I switched to this, there would be no good way to keep them together. There could be half a dozen &#8220;iPhone&#8221; pages on the site in different categories, each with their own ratings and reviews. (In programmer speak, categories and pages would be a &#8220;one to many&#8221; relationship instead of a &#8220;many to many&#8221; relationship.) This bothers me a bit&#8230;but maybe it would be worth it for the simplicity?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really not sure. These are all just ideas. I&#8217;ve been looking at some other similar sites too for ideas: see <a href="http://www.makefive.com/">http://www.makefive.com/</a> and Google Moderator powered sites like <a href="http://change.gov/page/content/openforquestions20081229/">this</a> (click &#8220;view questions&#8221;).</p>

<p>I need to find something that is a powerful voting engine, but drop dead simple to use and remove every single mental barrier possible. Eliminating the need to create a new account since you can <a href="http://buyersvote.com/user_session/new">use one your already have</a>, for example, was a big step toward that.</p>

<p><strong>Please let me know what you think in the comments.</strong></p>

<p>And until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Since this post became so popular, I just setup a discussion forum where we can all discuss further and meet other folks living with or researching DSPS.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Click here to visit <a href="http://dsps.ribbot.com">http://dsps.ribbot.com</a></strong></p>

<p>The forum is brand new, but please sign up, introduce yourself and post any questions you might have.  Thanks!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t do posts about my personal life that often, but I thought this one might help some people.</p>

<p>DSPS is a sleeping disorder (Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome) and while I only found out it had a name years later, I started experiencing it around the time I entered high school (13 years old).</p>

<p>Here is a simple description of it:</p>

<blockquote><p>The major feature of these disorders is a misalignment between the patient&#8217;s sleep pattern and the sleep pattern that is desired or regarded as the societal norm&#8230;. In most circadian rhythm sleep disorders, the underlying problem is that the patient cannot sleep when sleep is desired, needed or expected.</p></blockquote>

<p>The symptoms are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Regardless of how sleep deprived you are, you are unable to fall asleep until very late</p></li>
<li><p>Once you do fall asleep you can sleep for a normal amount of time, this differentiates it from other sleep disorders like insomnia</p></li>
<li><p>There is a relatively severe to absolute inability to advance the sleep phase to earlier hours</p></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boxercab/352484722/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/06/200906130449.jpg" alt="200906130449.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I first started noticing this problem around the time I entered high school. I&#8217;d have to wake up fairly early (7am?) for school every day and of course it was difficult. This in itself was not remarkable. What was remarkable was that I would be unable to fall asleep before 2 or 3am any night, even after five days of little sleep.</p>

<p>So you can imagine Monday goes by on 4 hours of sleep. You aren&#8217;t feeling great. You should be tired the next night right? Nope&#8230;I would be exhausted all day, but as 9PM started to roll around I&#8217;d finally wake up for the day and start to get my best work done. Hours would just fly by like nothing. Even at 2 or 3 AM I was wide awake and could have easily kept going. But I knew I had to wake up in 4 hours and would force myself to go to bed.</p>

<p>The second day goes by on 4 hours of sleep. You feel even worse. Surely, tonight your body should be wanting to catch up on sleep right? Nope&#8230;same problem (you&#8217;re exhausted all day but start to wake up at night). Even when I would &#8220;go to bed&#8221; at 10 or 11PM to try and catch up, I would literally lie there awake in bed for hours and hours (until about 3AM) bored out of my mind.</p>

<p>The entire week goes by like this, each day getting worse and worse (in the morning and throughout the day) as you are in permanent jet lag, yet you can&#8217;t fall asleep any earlier.</p>

<p>The best way I can describe it is if you&#8217;ve ever had to wake up in the middle of the night and do something in a deep sleep. It&#8217;s like if you suddenly had to start getting up for work every day at 1AM.</p>

<p>I was on an entirely different schedule than the rest of the world, and couldn&#8217;t adjust no matter how hard I tried.</p>

<p><strong>The Worst Part About It: People&#8217;s Perceptions</strong></p>

<p>By far the worst part of DSPS is the societal stigma around it. Obviously, most people (even doctors) have never heard of it. It only affects 0.17% of the population. And most people when you tell them about it think it&#8217;s bullshit or that you&#8217;re lazy/making excuses.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a habit you have to get into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I find exercise/light reading helps me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You just have to give up caffeine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, I tried all these things and all of them help me fall asleep faster: at 3AM. That&#8217;s just what my body considers it&#8217;s normal bed time.</p>

<p>It can be frustrating at times because people make suggestions about it that come across as patronizing. Sometimes you just want to scream &#8220;duh! this has been messing with my life every day for the last 10 years, don&#8217;t you think I would have tried not drinking caffeine and saved myself the trouble 10 years ago!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>But obviously, you can&#8217;t blame other people. If I was in their shoes I probably wouldn&#8217;t believe it either. People invent all sorts of limitations which are entirely mental.</p>

<p>After reading every piece of literature I could find and trying dozens of treatments to fix it over the last 10 years, I&#8217;m fairly convinced that it is a genetic predisposition for me though and not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic">psychosomatic</a> (possibly still curable but I haven&#8217;t found anything reliable yet). <strong>(Edit: check out the comments below where people mention various remedies they&#8217;ve had success with.  Taking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin">melatonin</a> has worked quite well for me, and I&#8217;d recommend it.)</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the worst offenders in the &#8220;people&#8217;s perceptions&#8221; category for me was my parents. Throughout high school (and partially even to this day, I&#8217;m not really sure) they did not believe it or fully understand it.</p>

<p>Obviously, after a school week of sleeping four hours per night (and falling asleep again Friday night at 3AM) my body was DESPERATE to sleep a full 8-12 hours on the weekend till noon or later. My parents weren&#8217;t happy about this and believed it was a sign of laziness. They would play all sorts of games to get me up on time (I was not amused - again, imagine being woken up at the equivalent of 1AM after a week of sleep deprivation - I believe the North Koreans use similar tactics in labor camps! :).</p>

<p>To their credit, I know they only wanted the best for me, and they didn&#8217;t know. DSPS wasn&#8217;t even formally recognized as a sleeping disorder until 1981, a few years before I was born, so they had no way of knowing.</p>

<p>Still, it was tough.</p>

<p><strong>A World Designed Without You In Mind</strong></p>

<p>For a long time, I felt like one of those 7 foot basketball players where doorways and airplanes seats never fit you. The world was just not designed for me.</p>

<p>Teachers in high school would routinely harass me for not being alert. I remember actually having hallucinations (the medical term for this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsleep">microsleep</a>) while sitting in class fairly often - a common symptom of extreme sleep deprivation. I didn&#8217;t know this wasn&#8217;t normal. I figured everyone just &#8220;spaces out&#8221; sometimes. It&#8217;s a really bizarre feeling to have your eyes open while dreaming. You are frozen, almost paralyzed, for 10 seconds or so in a trance until you jerk back suddenly to reality.</p>

<p>College was better, I was able to schedule many of my classes in the afternoon. However, not all of them. Early morning exams were difficult. There is well documented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep">evidence</a> about the negative effects of sleep deprivation, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mental acuity decreases significantly</p></li>
<li><p>Healing - a 2007 study showed a 20% decrease in white blood cell count in sleep deprived rats as compared to a control group</p></li>
<li><p>A variety of accidents including the Exxon Valdez spill and Chernobyl nuclear reactor meltdown have been linked to sleep deprived workers</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I remember one time in college I went to the gym (it was a small weight room and nobody else was there). I was laying on the incline bench, and put down a set of weights. A moment later I woke up and looked at my watch. An <strong>hour and a half</strong> had gone by. I had fallen asleep in the middle of the gym without even knowing it.</p>

<p>There were other incidents as well. In the mornings driving to school I would sometimes fall asleep at stop lights. When it turned green people would honk behind me and I&#8217;d wake back up. Obviously not the safest way to drive.</p>

<p>Again, all I can compare it to is imagine having to wake up at 1am to take an exam. You probably wouldn&#8217;t do quite as well, right?</p>

<p>This is probably what bothers me about it the most: I feel like I was cheated out of a lot of learning especially in high school (and partially in college). I mean, everything considered I still did pretty well, but if that&#8217;s how I did being under under extreme sleep deprivation EVERY DAY, just imagine how much I could have accomplished fully rested! Imagine the energy, connections, opportunities, clubs, etc. Ah well&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Discovering I Wasn&#8217;t The Only One</strong></p>

<p>Years later (it was toward the end of college) I had become somewhat of a student on sleep disorders during my free time. I had read extensively on it and tried a number of experiments to try and correct it (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic">polyphasic</a> sleeping, expensive <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/tired-in-the-morning-and-awake-at-night-here-is-a-real-solution.html">light therapy devices</a> which worked but didn&#8217;t have a long term effect, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotherapy">chronotherapy</a>, and others).</p>

<p>One day I came across this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_syndrome">wikipedia article on DSPS</a> and I was absolutely STUNNED. It felt like it was describing me perfectly and as I read it, I thought &#8220;my God, someone else actually knows about this and has it&#8230;and there is a name for it&#8221;. It sounds silly but I think the most important thing I realized was that I WASN&#8217;T CRAZY.</p>

<p>My entire life up to that point I had always wondered if people were right, maybe I was just lazy or kidding myself. Finding this article at least brought some validity to my own experiences, and let me know there were people out their actively researching it.</p>

<p>Thank God for the internet. It allowed me to <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/blog/entry/?EntryID=175&amp;print=1">self diagnose</a> what would have easily gone unrecognized by a dozen doctors due to it&#8217;s obscurity (DSPS is frequently mis-diagnosed as insomnia or depression, often involving the prescription of psychoactive drugs - thankfully that didn&#8217;t happen).</p>

<p>Despite my excitement over the article, I was somewhat disheartened to learn that even with the best treatments available today (light therapy, melatonin, etc) it is still largely incurable with 90% of patients seeing a relapse within 1 year. At least I knew I wasn&#8217;t alone.</p>

<p>Update 1: A new theory I have on this is that light from staring at a computer monitor can worsen this or even be the main cause of DSPS.  It is essentially light therapy, but at the wrong time.  Anecdotally, lots of computer scientists I know seem to have delayed sleep schedules, but I don&#8217;t have any hard evidence of this so it remains just a theory.  If you have any experience with it let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Update 2: I take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin">melatonin</a> now to fall asleep earlier.  A 3mg dose is effective and safe from what I&#8217;ve read on it.  This has been by far the best solution I&#8217;ve found.</p>

<p><strong>Adapting To Life</strong></p>

<p>This shows up in my job where I prefer to work later and come in later to be more productive.  Melatonin has made this easier but I still prefer not to work before 10AM.</p>

<p>I also rarely schedule early flights and don&#8217;t attend meetings before noon if it can at all be avoided. I absolutely despise alarm clocks and consider it a matter of personal pride that I don&#8217;t own one and only ever use one (my cell phone) a few times a year for special events.</p>

<p>The occasional one day of sleep deprivation is manageable for special events where I need to get up early. Its the multiple days in a row that are really bad and cause the microsleeps (hallucinations), so those are luckily a thing of the past.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ll just close by saying that this post is not a &#8220;poor me&#8221; cry for help. On the contrary, if this is the worst genetic disorder life has to throw at me I&#8217;m home free - I got an easy one and it barely affects me at all today. Also, for some people it apparently fades out later in life. Older people naturally sleep less, so it may (or may not) go away on it&#8217;s own.</p>

<p>If you have any sort of similar health problem read the next paragraph:</p>

<p>Lots of people take a negative attitude toward these things and say &#8220;great, 0.17% of the population gets this and of course I&#8217;M the one to get it!&#8221; But that&#8217;s bullshit, there are tons of diseases/disorders you probably have a 0.17% of getting, and adding them all up means you have a pretty good chance of having SOMETHING if not lots of them. DSPS is much better than a lot of problems I can think of having, and I feel EXTREMELY lucky to have been born with all the other advantages I have in life. I&#8217;ve got zero room for whining on something like this.</p>

<p>But I thought I&#8217;d post it out there for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A lot of entrepreneurs I&#8217;ve met seem to have this, and don&#8217;t know they have it. They might feel like I did (like something is wrong with them) and this will help them to understand it. And&#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>So that if you ever invite me to a morning meeting, you&#8217;ll understand when I don&#8217;t show up&#8230; :)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was thinking the other day about the times in history where there have been opportunities to generate huge amounts of wealth.</p>

<p>It seems to be when a new piece of technology comes along that is a TOTAL game changer.</p>

<p>In recent memory of course is the internet, and all the things it has enabled. A small example being distribution of media such as music and video, and reducing the cost of publishing content to basically zero.</p>

<p>But this trend is not new and has been going on throughout history.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_wealthy_historical_figures"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/06/picture-3.png" alt="Picture 3.png" /></a></p>

<p>What about the printing press? It was basically the first internet. Even before that, what about the first civilization to create an alphabet or writing?</p>

<p>What about when everyone was using coal and then oil came along? HUGE amounts of wealth generated.</p>

<p>What about when everyone was running around on horses and then railroads came along? COMPLETE game changer.</p>

<p>What about when everyone was using blocks of ice and then refrigeration was invented?</p>

<p>Steel? Plastic? Agriculture? The wheel? Flight?</p>

<p>Wikipedia actually has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_wealthy_historical_figures">list of the wealthiest people in history</a> (adjusted for inflation) and you can see that aside from Royalty (which doesn&#8217;t really count as earning it since you&#8217;re born into it) most of them are people who got in early on a complete game changing technology.</p>

<p>The trick is getting in at the right time.</p>

<p><strong>Coming in too early:</strong> There are also lots of &#8220;next big things&#8221; which turn out to never materialize, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_car_(aircraft">flying car</a>) or a battery which lasts a long time. People have been waiting for those for 50 years. So it&#8217;s definitely not easy to bet on the next big thing and be right. You have to hedge your bets.</p>

<p><strong>Coming in too late:</strong> The market for oil and automobiles is very mature today. It would be very difficult to build the next great oil company today, or shoe manufacturing company, or any other mature industry where there are strong incumbents. So it pays to be looking for the NEXT big one, not ones that have already passed. If you can be the only expert around when it does hit then you&#8217;re positioned well to capitalize. This requires you to toil away in a particular industry when a lot of people probably think you&#8217;re wasting your time.</p>

<p>I feel like the internet still has lots of untapped potential, and it&#8217;s probably one of your best opportunities for generating wealth today. But it&#8217;s starting to feel a bit mature at times.</p>

<p><strong>So that begs the question: what do you think is going to be the next big thing?</strong></p>

<p>For me I see some of these being complete game changers where people will build huge amounts of wealth. See if you agree with my predictions. Maybe you can get in early on one of these&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>genetic engineering (crops, bacteria for various purposes, and most importantly humans to prevent various diseases)</p></li>
<li><p>robotics (the military will increasingly become unmanned - casualties are more acceptable if they&#8217;re robots)</p></li>
<li><p>artificial intelligence (I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins">Jeff Hawkins</a> and his company Numenta have a good chance of solving this in the next 5-10 years, btw it will not be like terminator, the part of our brain which accounts for desires and motives is very old and easy to replicate or leave out of a robot, the hard part is the neo-cortex which other mammals don&#8217;t have and is good at learning to make good <em>predictions</em> - this would definitely be a game changer - for more check out his excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805078533?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0805078533">On Intelligence</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Renewable energy, in particular solar and electric vehicles</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend I took a day trip to Tigre, Argentina which is a little town on a river delta about an hour outside Buenos Aires. I went with some people who live in the same house, and met some new people along the way. It has nice boat trips, restaurants, and some boardwalk/themepark type stuff.</p>

<p>It was a fun outing. I looked at some tourist packages that charged $75 or $100 USD to take a trip to Tigre. But my Argentine friends said it was a waste of money and i should just take the train and get a boat when I got there.</p>

<p>They turned out to be right. The train ticket was a whopping 1.35 pesos (or 36 cents USD) and the boat ride was 18 pesos (less than 5 USD). Glad I didn&#8217;t take that &#8220;tour&#8221; for Americans!</p>

<p>Here is some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pb3KCQc9q4">video I shot</a>:</p>

<p>Audio is by <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/hisboyelroy/430">hisboyelroy</a> via ccmixter.org.</p>

<p><strong>Update On UniversityTutor.com</strong></p>

<p>My transition back to the old business model of monthly subscribers is now complete. I&#8217;ve already started to recover some subscribers. I&#8217;m split testing 2 price points right now of $9.95 per month or $89.95 per year vs $5 per month or $45 per year. I&#8217;ll report back the results on that after a few months collecting data.</p>

<p>It feels good to be back on track with that - the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-secret-to-working-less-producing-more-and-getting-rich/">water wheel</a> is running again! To transition I simply put together an email for all tutors. Nobody was upset by the change like last time and the response has largely been positive.</p>

<p>My next goal will be to get UniversityTutor going in some more countries. I&#8217;m going to start with English speaking countries first because it&#8217;s a major amount of work to internationalize a website into a bunch of languages. But there are still plenty of places to start (England, Canada, Australia, large parts of Europe, etc).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll then probably do another marketing round to university students there.</p>

<p>First step will be to import this <a href="http://www.maxmind.com/app/worldcities">huge free database of cities</a> around the world (thanks to MaxMind.com for open sourcing it). This will help with the SEO for each new city so that a page is created for all tutors who sign up there.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s easy to take things for granted and forget how good you have it. This morning I had to pinch myself. If I had been following the &#8220;normal&#8221; life plan I&#8217;d have woken up at 7AM this morning and gone do a job I probably hated. Instead I woke up at noon in Buenos Aires and went to work for myself.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

<time datetime="2009-05-27T05:58:32-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 27<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you might have seen a few weeks ago, I posted about how the new <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/new-universitytutor-business-model-not-working/">UniversityTutor.com business model wasn&#8217;t working</a> very well. Revenue has fallen by about half during this time.</p>

<p>Also, it&#8217;s not just the summer time effect. There are still a fairly large number of contacts going through the site (see below). Even taking this into account, it does not look good.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking long and hard about it over the last week, and I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s probably time to cut my losses on the &#8220;online payments&#8221; business model and go back to the subscription model I was using before. Adoption of the online payment system has been very low - and most people aren&#8217;t using it (probably a combination of the fact that is less convenient, and also to avoid the fee).</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/05/funny-pictures-doh-cat.jpg" alt="funny-pictures-doh-cat.jpg" /></p>

<p>At least I know that my previous business model was working fairly well and growing steadily - and this test to see if I could beat it has just about reached it&#8217;s conclusion (2 months).</p>

<p>I <a href="http://homeworkhelpblog.com/should-universitytutorcom-get-rid-of-online-payments-as-a-business-model/">surveyed some of the tutors</a> this week to get their feedback, and you can read some reactions there.</p>

<p>Also, here are a few emails I&#8217;ve written to people over the last week which summarize my thought process:</p>

<blockquote><p>Just had a big realization: if it was me, I don&#8217;t think I would use the online invoicing either. I would be cool with it when I saw it and probably have every intention of using it. Then I&#8217;d go do a session, and the person would say, well shall I just write you a check? And I wouldn&#8217;t know what to say say because it was my first time meeting them, and it would almost be rude not to, so i&#8217;d just say ok. Then afterward, I&#8217;d go read about the benefits of getting paid online and think about it&#8230;but now that I&#8217;ve already accepted the higher amount of money once&#8230;it would be really hard to go back and give up the extra money next time especially when nothing bad happened from the first time I did it, so I&#8217;d probably just say forget it and keep doing it the same way unless the parent didn&#8217;t show or something and I had to get paid later.</p></blockquote>

<p>So yeah&#8230;when I just went through the whole process in my mind like I was a new tutor signing up, I realized that I probably would not use the invoice thing. That is a bad sign if even I wouldn&#8217;t do it.</p>

<blockquote><p>The argument for it being summer is a valid one, but not really. I&#8217;ve been watching the number of daily contacts going through the site. Last semester it was averaging about 60 per day and right now it is still doing 40 per day so it really hasn&#8217;t dropped that much. Even if I take this into account (30-50% drop), it doesn&#8217;t make up for the lack of adoption.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m also thinking about split testing $5/month vs $10/month to see which is more profitable. I realized also that offering a yearly subscription with a discount to the tutor is common online and could really help cashflow (since you get more up front).</p>

<blockquote><p>After reading this I&#8217;m starting to think the price point of $10/month might be wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/23/free-to-use-pay-to-play/">http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/23/free-to-use-pay-to-play/</a></p>

<p>I also need to include an option to pay yearly instead of monthly. There is good research this improves conversions and helps cash flow to get the money up front.</p>

<p>Maybe give the option of $5 per month or $45 per year. Something like that where it&#8217;s a no brainer to sign up. I&#8217;d have to test it&#8230;but to me I&#8217;d def sign up for $5 per month whereas $10/month I&#8217;d hesitate and have to think about it. If I remember right, the conversion rate for $10 per month after people&#8217;s free account ran out was about 10% so at $5/month it would have to be at least 20% to make it worthwhile.</p>

<p><strong>Closing thoughts&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>On the one hand it is sort of depressing to do all the work to launch a big feature like this, and NOT have it work. Worse still, the number of subscribers has fallen by about half since I launched the feature. That means it will probably take at least several months to get it back to where it was previously revenue wise. It&#8217;s also hard not to think about where it could be right now if I had just left it instead of changing things :)</p>

<p>But on the other hand, this is the reality of business. If you don&#8217;t test then you will never know. And a failed test is much better than staying stagnant with your business. You have to look at things over a longer time frame (say 5 or 10 years) where losing $1000 in revenue early on is nothing, but getting the right business model in place could translate into millions of dollars down the road.</p>

<p>So in short, I&#8217;m glad I did it, but it&#8217;s still not easy to admit defeat and realize your idea didn&#8217;t work. Such is the life of an entrepreneur - you gotta stay mentally tough and get back on the horse after every setback.</p>

<p>Hey, if it was easy - everyone would be a millionaire, right? :)</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Scott Adam&#8217;s has a great post out today on how <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/teamwork/">teamwork can hurt your productivity</a>.</p>

<p>I personally despise working in teams and rarely if ever do it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/omar_eduardo/127707517/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/05/127707517_1ce118b77a.jpg" alt="127707517_1ce118b77a" /></a></p>

<p>If I need to get something done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Outsource it to a contractor</li>
</ul>


<p>If I need to figure out what to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brainstorm it with select mentors and friends</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8220;Friends&#8221; also includes making a blog post and getting feedback from people that way.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s better to be the sole decision maker on any project.  Otherwise too much time is lost in keeping everyone on the team up to date and making sure their feelings don&#8217;t get hurt.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also much more efficient to not have to justify your ideas to other people and try to convince them.  If I&#8217;m convinced, or I think someone has given me some good advice, I just start working on it right away without delay.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s a mistake to ever say &#8220;hey can you two be in charge of XYZ?&#8221;  If you watch <a href="http://www.mtv.com/videos/the-city-ep-11-fool-me-twice-shame-on-me/1605864/playlist.jhtml">The City</a> or The Apprentice you&#8217;ve seen examples of this gone wrong.  The same is true in planning a birthday party or night on the town.  Pick one person to be in charge or you&#8217;ll get drama, not results.</p>

<p>What do you think about teamwork?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last year or two I&#8217;ve been hosting this blog (and others) on 1and1 Hosting with a shared hosting plan. While it was very inexpensive (about $10 per mont) the performance has been seriously lacking lately.</p>

<p>On a regular basis I would come to the homepage, or try to log into the backend, only to find the entire site was down or unresponsive. So I haven&#8217;t been very happy with 1and1.</p>

<p>It would usually come back up fairly quickly as 1and1 would reboot the server quite often, but it was frustrating and very slow to use. If I was getting frustrated using my own site, then I imagine many users as well.</p>

<p>So I finally bit the bullet and moved several blogs over to my hosting account on <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/slicehost/">SliceHost</a>. My hosting plan with SliceHost is a virtual private server (VPS) which should offer better performance. I already had this account because I was using it to host UniversityTutor.com (Ruby On Rails apps require more than what a shared plan can offer), and the extra capacity should be enough to run StartBreakingFree.com and HomeworkHelpBlog.com along side it.
<a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/slicehost/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/05/slicehost.gif" alt="slicehost.png" /></a></p>

<p>In case you didn&#8217;t know, there are basically 3 tiers of web hosting you can get:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shared</strong> - this is the cheapest and lowest performance, basically it means perhaps dozens (or more) websites are all running off the same web server</p></li>
<li><p><strong>VPS</strong> - this the mid range both in price and performance and mimics a private server by running less than a dozen &#8220;virtual|&#8221; operating systems on one server. You get a private IP address, root access, and freedom to change whatever you want so there is more control.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Private Server</strong> - this is the most expensive and most performance. Also the most freedom - it&#8217;s an entire webserver to yourself. It&#8217;s just that someone else manages it to make sure it has electricity and reliable internet at all times.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So basically, I moved from a shared plan with 1and1 for about $10/month to a VPS with SliceHost for about $48/month. Except I was already paying the $48/month to host UniversityTutor.com so I will actually save a little bit by canceling 1and1.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/slicehost/">SliceHost&#8217;s 512MB plan</a> is enough to host all my sites right now and I can&#8217;t recommend these guys enough. I&#8217;ll probably be doing all my hosting with them in the future. If you are a bit tech savvy their hosting is awesome, and they have really knowledgeable folks sitting in a chat room at all hours in case anything goes down.</p>

<p>With 1and1 you&#8217;d wait 48 hours to get an email back from their support team who obviously didn&#8217;t speak English, and would just send you a template email response that wasn&#8217;t helpful at all. SliceHost has people who actually know what they are doing sitting in the chat room at all hours.</p>

<p>Moving everything over was a big process with a lot of steps, so if you see anything broken or not working anymore, drop me a comment below. Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I shot some video today while walking around BA.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s gotten a little bit colder here lately and it was overcast today but still pretty nice.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UryRMO16MK0">YouTube video</a>:</p>

<p>Few other random discoveries since last week:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#8217;s more expensive to buy groceries here than it is to eat in restaurants. Sort of the opposite of the U.S. The people running restaurants must be buying it direct from farmers of something because they certainly aren&#8217;t buying food from grocery stores where I am. If you go try to put together a breakfast or any meal at the grocery store, it is about double the cost of just buying it at a restaurant. Luckily the restaurants are great here.</p></li>
<li><p>The house comes will a full time maid - I thought this would be really awesome, but it&#8217;s really not as awesome as it seems. Our maid, while very nice, doesn&#8217;t really seem to clean much :). The first day I was here she took my towels to wash them and I have yet to see them again. I&#8217;ve tried to ask her about them a few times, and she seems to understand&#8230;.yet still I have no towels. I have taken to drying my entire body with a washcloth&#8230;this I keep in my room now for fear that it will also disappear to be &#8220;washed&#8221;. All part of the South American experience!</p></li>
<li><p>Shop owners here have this weird strategy: if we sell the same thing, let&#8217;s all put all our shops right next to each other. It&#8217;s sort of bizarre, they have these little &#8220;gallerias&#8221; where there will literally be 40 shops that all sell electronics or all sell leather, etc. The products in all of them are identical, prices are just about identical.
I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out why they do this because they have no way to differentiate from the other guys. Like, if you are the 40th guy to open a shop with the same products in the same location, what are you hoping to accomplish? Aside from the occasional double starbucks, business owners in the U.S. are pretty good about saying &#8220;hey I&#8217;m going to open a gym, maybe I should go where there isn&#8217;t already a gym&#8230;&#8221;. Haven&#8217;t figured this one out yet.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>UniversityTutor.com Update</strong></p>

<p>After my last update on how the new <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/new-universitytutor-business-model-not-working/">UniversityTutor business model wasn&#8217;t working</a>, I&#8217;ve made some good progress.</p>

<p>I added the new line to all outgoing emails as I mentioned and this improved things back to 1 or 2 invoices per day almost immediately. I also added a suggestion by my mother, to also include in the email how many hours of experience and reviews the tutor currently has. This would reinforce the benefits of accumulating these.</p>

<p>Also, as you (my valuable blog readers) pointed out, a big reason for the change I saw was the month. School was ending! Thanks for the reminder on that one&#8230;this was an important point that I had forgotten.</p>

<p>In short, I will continue to test it and expand it. I&#8217;m looking at some ways to expand it to other English speaking countries in the future. After debating a lot, I feel like the current business model is the right one. The number of tutors signing up is increasing dramatically now that there is no monthly fee. It will just take some time to adopt it I think.</p>

<p><strong>BuyersVote.com Update</strong></p>

<p>Here is another one I could use your help one.</p>

<p>While there are a few more features I&#8217;d like to clean up on the site (such as designing the home page to direct people to add a page instead of search, especially in the early stages here) the site is about 90% complete feature wise for what I want.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for the site now is to reach some sort of critical mass. It&#8217;s needs it&#8217;s community of early adopters who will evangelize it.</p>

<p>My best guess to accomplishing this right now is to partner with someone who has the permission asset to get the word out. I&#8217;ve emailed Tim Ferriss (his assistant actually) to see if I can get through to him. He will occasionally do advisory roles for things like this if he believes in it (in exchange for a small piece of the company), but he is a difficult person to reach so we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on how to accomplish this critical mass? Also, does the homepage draw first time people in well or what would be improved there? Please leave me a comment below.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!
Brian Armstrong</p>
