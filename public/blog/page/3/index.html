  <div class="entry-content"><p>Random thought for the day: for the next version of Apple&#8217;s operating system, they should really think about synching all your programs, settings, etc across ALL your computers.</p>

<p>Right now I carry a MacBook Pro between home and work every day because maintaining all my programs, files, and settings on two separate machines would simply be far too much work.  Why can&#8217;t those all be in the cloud?  I&#8217;d love to have the raw power and convenience of desktop machines at home and work - but the software underneath would have to all be the same virtualized computer or it would be too much of a hassle.</p>

<p>How many more computers could Apple sell if everyone who currently uses a MacBook as their primary machine went out and bought a desktop or two to complement it?</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they are already working on this&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like the idea of a business that creates building blocks.</p>

<p>In other words, your product may not be directly useful to customers, but it allows <strong>other people to create useful products</strong>.</p>

<p>Amazon EC2 is a a building block.  So is Apple&#8217;s App Store.  So are Heroku, Wordpress, Paypal, and a bunch more.</p>

<p>Some things that are cool about building a &#8220;platform&#8221; or building block like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>You&#8217;re higher up the food chain</strong><br/>
The guy who makes a great iPhone app makes $100 thousand.  The guy (Steve Jobs) who makes the the App store makes $100 million.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You make other people rich</strong><br/>
If you make a great toaster, you can be proud of yourself in the sense that people enjoy your product and you&#8217;ve made their lives &#8220;richer&#8221; in some abstract sense.  But if you create Google Adsense, you&#8217;ve made a bunch of people richer in a very literal sense - they can buy groceries this week with the check you sent them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It&#8217;s the easiest sell in the world<br/>
Telling someone &#8220;hey if I bring you an extra $100, would you give me $10 of it?&#8221; is the easiest pitch in the world.  When you make good building blocks they sell themselves.</strong></p></li>
</ol>


<p>In short, a good way to make money is to help other people make more money.  Could your business work better as a building block instead of a direct-to-consumer product?</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!<br/>

<p>Totally agree that the mythical 6-10% return is not being achieved by many these days, and that the real pay off of selling a business can come from the credibility - not the money.</p>

<p>Definitely food for thought, Brian Armstrong</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve seen a few startups recently who want to have their customers sign contracts to get started.</p>

<p>The logic being that you can guarantee recurring income for your business (for the length of the contract) or you&#8217;ll have some recourse if the person fails to pay.</p>

<p>But there are two flaws with this thinking:</p>

<ol>
<li>If your product is actually good, customers will stick around whether you have a contract or not</li>
<li>If the customer owes you less than a few thousand dollars, it&#8217;s not even worth your time to sue them</li>
</ol>


<p>So if you are left with a contract that you&#8217;ll never enforce, why even ask for it in the first place?  All you&#8217;re doing is creating a hurdle to getting new customers to try your product.</p>

<p>Google Adwords is a good example.  Most agreements in the advertising world are still done with paper contracts, but Google decided to let anyone start advertising on Adwords in just a few minutes with no up front cost or contracts.</p>

<p>If you fail to pay your Adwords bill, Google isn&#8217;t going to sue you for $500.  It&#8217;s not worth their time.  They simply shut down your Adwords account until you pay your bill.  If two years later you are finally ready to try Adwords again, hey - no hard feelings - you can just pay it and your account is instantly re-enabled.</p>

<p>When I see an internet company asking for contracts up front, it feels like their product must not be very good - otherwise why wouldn&#8217;t they just let me try it knowing full well I&#8217;m likely to stick around?</p>

<p>Brian Armstrong</p>

<p>P.S. I certainly don&#8217;t mean to imply all contracts are bad.  For independent contractors, real estate, anything involving larger sums of money, etc it can make perfect sense.  But most internet companies are charging relatively small sums of money per person.  </p>

<p>P.P.S. Another way to look at is &#8220;what would it cost you if the customer doesn&#8217;t pay?&#8221;  Most internet companies have low marginal costs in their products (ad space, some CPU time, etc).  If you&#8217;re in a high margin business you can afford to give away all sorts of &#8220;free trials&#8221; in the form of people not paying after signing up.  It&#8217;s often worth it just to get your product in the hands of more people.</p>

<p>P.P.P.S.  Most companies (including Google) still make you agree to a &#8220;Terms of Service&#8221; by clicking a checkbox.  Don&#8217;t confuse this with a contract though.  The terms of service is usually there to prevent <em>you</em> from suing them, not the other way around, and it&#8217;s a sufficiently small hurdle that it probably won&#8217;t affect your signup rates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently put up a <a href="http://99designs.com/web-design/contests/universitytutor-needs-designer-love-47652">project on 99Designs.com</a> to get UniversityTutor redesigned.</p>

<p>I put up a $795 prize and got <a href="http://99designs.com/web-design/contests/universitytutor-needs-designer-love-47652">46 entries</a> from a half dozen designers</p>

<p>Most of the designs weren&#8217;t very good, but one designer stood out and I awarded him the prize.  His name is <a href="http://jackherbert.com/">Jack Herbert</a> and he is in the UK.  Below you can see the screenshots of his final design which I selected.</p>

<p>These are just photoshop images right now, so I&#8217;m spending the <del>evening</del> next few days turning them into CSS on the real site.  It should be launching soon.</p>

<p>Main takeaway: <strong>there is just no reason not to have a decent design for your web business these days</strong>.  For a reasonable price you can get some great design work done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is unfortunate.  I no longer have access to the Google Group I use for support <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/feedmailpro">http://groups.google.com/group/feedmailpro</a> on FeedmailPro.com.</p>

<p>It seems there is a known bug with Groups where people are getting unsubscribed.  This happened to me, which in itself is no big deal.  But when I re-subscribed by emailing the +subscribe address for the group, my ownership of the group disappeared!</p>

<p>This means I can&#8217;t moderate incoming messages and no new members can be added. The group is currently orphaned, without an owner, and there are pending messages waiting from customers that have gotten no response.  I can&#8217;t even delete the group to recreate it since I&#8217;m no longer the owner.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/is-something-broken/browse_frm/thread/d3abee6cb34ef1d7/68dea94927a42561?lnk=gst&amp;q=ownership+removed#68dea94927a42561">posted</a> to the Google Groups support forum to see if anyone could help.  But it looks like they are swamped and I haven&#8217;t gotten any reply.</p>

<p>Googlers, can anyone out there help?  Has anyone had better luck with an alternative platform for Q&amp;A and customer support?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Twitter is currently trying sponsored trending topics, ads, and licensing deals to see if they can monetize their platform.  But there is a much simpler business model right in front of them: freemium.</p>

<p>Make it free for up to 10,000 followers.  If you have more than that, it&#8217;s $5 a month.  Over 100,000 followers maybe $49 a month.  Over a million followers $99 a month.  Etc.</p>

<p>The exact numbers aren&#8217;t important.  This tiered business model is proven to work by lots of <a href="http://www.aweber.com/pricing.htm">companies</a>, and anyone with that many followers is clearly deriving some sort of benefit that they should pay for.</p>

<p>This business model is so obvious - why haven&#8217;t they tried it?  I feel like I&#8217;m taking crazy pills over here.  What am I missing?</p>
