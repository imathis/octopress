  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I was doing <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/wtfree">keyword research</a> for my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">new tutoring business</a>, I came across an interesting discovery.</p>

<p><strong>People search online 10 times as often for &#8220;homework help&#8221; as they do for &#8220;tutor&#8221;.</strong></p>

<p>This was true across the board&#8230;&#8221;math homework help&#8221; searched 10 times as often as &#8220;math tutor&#8221;, etc.</p>

<p>Glenn Nicholas over at <a href="http://www.OM4Business.com">OM4Business.com</a> even wrote in to confirm this fact for me and point out that I needed to do something about it ASAP.</p>

<p>I had always been a little skeptical of the keyword &#8220;homework help&#8221;&#8230;you see, someone who types &#8220;math tutor in Houston, TX&#8221; into Google is almost certainly a good prospect.  Someone who would purchase tutoring.  But someone who types &#8220;homework help&#8221; into a search engine could be a kid (instead of a parent) or just someone looking to find the answer to a problem who would never hire a tutor.</p>

<p>Then again, I told my self, given that the keyword was searched 10 TIMES as often, I really couldn&#8217;t afford not to test it out.  After all, even if 75% of those searches never turned into customers&#8230;.the remaining 25% would represent a 250% increase over the current customers I was getting from tutoring related keywords.  What did I have to lose?</p>

<p>To further seal the deal, Glenn sent me a link about something called &#8221;<a href="http://om4.com.au/how-problem-marketing-can-help-you/">problem marketing</a>&#8221; which gave me a new perspective.  When people have back pain they type &#8220;back pain&#8221; into a search engine, because that is their problem.  They don&#8217;t know to type in &#8220;ergonomic chair&#8221; or &#8220;sciatic nerve therapy&#8221; or whatever, because those are SOLUTIONS.</p>

<p>Similarly, tutoring was the solution and homework help was the problem&#8230;so maybe, just maybe, I was marketing the wrong keyword.</p>

<p>Anyway, the results of this little experiment remains to be seen (and I will post them on the blog), but the point of this article is that I wanted to show you how easy it was to put up a new professional looking website to test out this idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://homeworkhelpblog.com"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/06/homework-help-blog1.png" alt="Homework Help Blog" /></a>The site I created is called <a href="http://www.homeworkhelpblog.com">HomeworkHelpBlog.com</a> and it is a free resource (a blog) for students who needs help on their homework.</p>

<p>Saavy readers might notice that I used a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/qa-with-breaking-free-readers/">domain with the keyword in it</a>, to help it rank in search engines.  The idea will be to offer free advice and tips on this site for students (my tutors can help me generate the content eventually) and build a list of subscribers who may eventually turn into tutoring customers.</p>

<p><strong>The entire site from start to finish took 4 hours and $6.95 to create.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I already pay for hosting at <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/1and1">1and1</a> and adding a new domain was free.</p></li>
<li><p>I had to register the domain at <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-3033696-10378494">GoDaddy</a>, hence the $6.95</p></li>
<li><p>To build the entire site I used <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress</a> (again free) so there was no programming involved</p></li>
<li><p>The slick looking design was created by someone else and given away free (just google &#8220;best wordpress themes&#8221;).  I installed it, again, with no programming to give it a custom look and feel.</p></li>
<li><p>From start to finish it took me about 4 hours doing it entirely myself</p></li>
</ul>


<p>One of the bonuses that comes with <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">Breaking Free</a> is a book on how to use Wordpress for exactly this reason.</p>

<p>It makes it very simple and easy to put up a business website ANY TIME you have an idea like this.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
I think the main points to take away from this article are&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There is a quick and inexpensive way to test out any business idea you have: starting a business website.  I&#8217;ve shown how easy it is here, so really there is no excuse not to put together one of these when you have a good idea (or pay someone to do it).  Maybe 1 out of 10 will really work out and you&#8217;ll have a business on your hand that can allow you to quit your job.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to understand <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/qa-with-breaking-free-readers/">keyword research</a>.  If I hadn&#8217;t done the research I never would have known that &#8220;homework help&#8221; was so much more popular than tutoring keywords.  That information could turn out to be priceless if it doubles or triples my business.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Hi Brian - are you using a self-directed IRA for your real estate investments?  Also, what sort of retirement account are you using for your business.  SEP-IRA vs 401K.
Thanks,
Chris</p></blockquote>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>

<p>This is a great question, and it might surprise you to hear that I don&#8217;t use any IRA&#8217;s or 401K&#8217;s whatsoever.</p>

<p>The reason is simply that I&#8217;m working toward building financial freedom which is quite a bit different than working toward retirement.  Let me explain&#8230;</p>

<p>What most people do (working toward retirement) is to save a bunch of money so that one day when you are 60 or whatever you can finally stop trading 8 hours of every day for a paycheck.  Then in your old age you live off your savings, pinching pennies and hoping that you die before your money runs out.</p>

<p>Working toward financial freedom is a little different.  The way I define financial freedom is that your <strong>passive</strong> income exceeds your expenses.  So if all your expenses, including everything from rent to movie tickets, is about $3,000 per month (just as an example) and your passive income is $4,000 per month, when do you have to go back to work?</p>

<p>The answer is of course, never.  So why have a retirement account?  That same passive income will be there whether you are retired or not.  It will be there whether you are 20 years old or 80 years old.  It will be there whether you are bed ridden or in good health.</p>

<p>In fact it will continue to grow as you reinvest (plus real estate income automatically adjusts for inflation, etc).</p>

<p>Anyway, businesses that you own or invest in, real estate, book royalties, etc.  These are all good passive income models.</p>

<p><a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-the-rich-think-differently-than-the-poor-and-middle-class/">Kiyosaki</a> has some great stuff on this topic by the way.</p>

<p>I had a Roth IRA for years before I started getting more into this stuff but I decided to stop using it because of the above reasons.  Basically I wanted to be financially free in something like 5 years, and waiting to take advantage of it until I was 65 made no sense to me.</p>

<p>The penalty for liquidating it was miniscule too, since all contributions to it are untouched and they made up 95% of the value.  Only got taxes and penalized on the 5% that was gains.</p>

<p>Before I finish up I just wanted to make a few other points.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many people do these types of retirement accounts for the tax advantages.  Real estate has huge tax advantages and I get the benefit now instead of waiting till I&#8217;m 65, so I prefer real estate.</p></li>
<li><p>Rich people don&#8217;t use these types of retirement accounts.  Do you think Bill Gates or Donald Trump have 401K&#8217;s and IRA&#8217;s?  They own businesses and real estate which pay them whether they work or not.</p></li>
<li><p>I realize that what I&#8217;ve said here goes totally against conventional wisdom that 90% of people follow.  And any financial planner reading this probably thinks its ridiculous.  But most financial planners aren&#8217;t rich (otherwise, why would they still be working) and I <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-worst-mistake-you-can-make-when-asking-for-advice/">get advice from rich people</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, this post can sound somewhat arrogant and it will probably challenge many people&#8217;s closely held beliefs about financial planning that they have followed for years.</p>

<p>So I will just end by saying that I don&#8217;t claim to know everything here.  I am very much a student of this as well.  This was simply the conclusion I came to after doing the research and talking to rich people, so thats what I decided to do.</p>

<p>Take it for what its worth, and keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These will be rapid fire responses.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.helpyourselfgetlucky.com/">HelpYourSelfGetLucky.com</a> asks:
I was wondering if you can shed some light or give some advice on how to break free when you have a family to support. I have a wife and 2 kids.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t have direct experience with this myself, but I can tell you that many entrepreneurs have still done it.</p>

<p>The only difference is that you can take a little less risk if you are the sole breadwinner.  As a bachelor you can quit and live off ramen noodles for a while if you are really dedicated, but as a father/husband you don&#8217;t want to mess things up at home.  That will just make it even harder to get a business started.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to stay at your current job while getting your business started on the side.  Wait to quit until you can match (or at least get close) to your current salary.  Set yourself a goal of how much you need each month coming in from your business before you can quit.  That will make it a real number to work toward.</p>

<p>This will not be easy, and you&#8217;ll be exhausted.  Stick with it, its worth it!</p>

<blockquote><p>Would you suggest using a straight forward domain name such as universitytutor.com as you used for your recent business or would you suggest using something a little more on the humorous side to get people’s attention and them to remember the name such as yahoo.com?</p></blockquote>

<p>For small sites I like using domains that contain your primary keywords.  This helps it rank in search engines and is a good trick.  For example <a href="http://www.houstonfinancetutor.com">this site</a> ranked #1 in Google for my primary keyword phrase &#8220;houston finance tutor&#8221; or &#8220;finance tutor houston&#8221; within 30 days just because of the domain name (did no other SEO).  Granted, its not a very competitive keyword.</p>

<p>But if you&#8217;re going to stick with a site for a long time and are willing to invest in making a real &#8220;brand&#8221; out of it then go for a more memorable name, even if it doesn&#8217;t directly suggest the product.</p>

<p>Quick tip on picking a brand name: the human brain likes names that have repetitive sounds (this is called alliteration).  Think about how memorable these phrases are, how they&#8217;ve spread, and how if you hear it once its impossible to forget: Coca Cola, Marilyn Monroe, Dunkin Donuts, Rolls Royce, King Kong, Bed Bath and Beyond.  Even pop culture phrases like &#8220;player hater&#8221; or &#8220;junk in the trunk&#8221; (note it doesn&#8217;t have to be the first letter that repeats, just the sound).  Anyway, if you can use alliteration it helps an idea spread.</p>

<blockquote><p>Caroline of <a href="http://www.lottolifestyle.com/">Lotto Lifestyle</a> asks:</p></blockquote>

<p>When working for yourself, what can you do that really works and what we should stay away from?</p>

<p>First of all nice use of alliteration in your domain name!  To build financial freedom I like real estate, I like new websites or pieces of software that <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/8-great-business-ideas-you-can-steal/">solve everyday problems</a>, I like subscription products or services, I like advice/information products a lot, I like blogging.</p>

<p>Stay away from any kind of network marketing or mlm type stuff (sorry I know some people on this site do that but I think they are generally a huge waste of time and have nothing to do with starting a real business), stay away from day trading or any stock stuff in general, stay away from trading time for money or labor intensive stuff (like opening a restaurant/franchise, etc), stay away from selling instant weight loss pills or anything you don&#8217;t genuinely believe in.</p>

<p>I heard Eben Pagen say one time that poor people have the mentality that &#8220;if I can just get a million people to give me one dollar each I&#8217;ll be rich&#8221;.  They have the mentality of getting.</p>

<p>Rich people have the mentality that &#8220;if I can GIVE AWAY $100 dollars of value to a million people, maybe some of them will give back $10 in return&#8221;.  They have the mentality of contributing a MASSIVE amount of value to a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/helping-individual-people-cant-make-you-rich/">MASSIVE amount of people</a>.</p>

<p>All those things I just mentioned to stay away from are (in my mind) more about getting something than contributing value.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have noticed that I added <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/ing-direct">ING Direct</a> as a sponsor for this site.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had an account with them since 2004 (long before this blog) and they are awesome.  Essentially they are a high interest savings account, and they offer far better rates than your bank.</p>

<p>In general their rates on a regular savings account (that means you can move money in or out any time you want) are about equal to a 12 month CD (where your money is LOCKED in) at a regular bank.</p>

<p>Right now their rates are only 3%, but they fluctuate with the economy and are often over 4%.  Thats earning 4% for free&#8230;.zero risk, move it whenever you want, insured by the federal government against loss.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-3033696-10420585">
<img src="http://www.tqlkg.com/image-3033696-10420585" alt="Click here to start saving with ING DIRECT!" /></a></p>

<p>The way they do this is that they have no local branches and therefore no overheard from that.  That is fine with me because I move the money in and out electronically, and use a local bank for my checking account.</p>

<p>Since I don&#8217;t invest in stocks, my money is only ever in one of two places:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Invested in real estate</p></li>
<li><p>Parked in ING Direct waiting for the next deal to come around that I like</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The only other two options I&#8217;ve heard about that come close to this are: (1) a competitor to ING that came out a while back called American something.  They offered a slightly higher rate to try and compete with ING but they were a small time operation and people complained of non existant customer support etc so it didn&#8217;t seem very safe.  And (2) high interest savings accounts in other countries where you get the benefit of currency exchange and things like that.  I&#8217;d be interested in learning more about this because the rates are higher, but just keep in mind it isn&#8217;t quite as safe because those accounts aren&#8217;t insured by the U.S. federal government like ING is.</p>

<p>Anyway, getting an ING account (or something like it) is pretty essential for building wealth in my opinion.  Because otherwise if you have some cash parked somewhere it is just losing value to inflation.  Tons of successful people I know use ING.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and there is no minimum deposit and no service fees so take a few minutes and <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/ing-direct">open an account</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve haven&#8217;t used their mortgage or checking accounts but the rates look equally good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>In your opinion, when does it make sense to follow the <a href="http://www.plentyoffish.com">plentyoffish</a> model (ad supported) vs. the provide a service and charge a subscription model.</p></blockquote>

<p>Taking that approach for example, someone could start a tutor site, make it ad supported, and potentially disrupt your site.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Aaron</p>

<p>This is a great question and I had to spend some time thinking about it.</p>

<p>What I came up with is that if you have the best site you can go with a subscription model, and if you don&#8217;t then a free ad supported version is a good alternative.  Here&#8217;s what I mean:</p>

<p>Usually its not too difficult to look at what&#8217;s already out there and do it just a little bit better.  This was the case with the tutoring website I put together.  What&#8217;s out there currently is really not very good, so I was able to make a better site, and hopefully people will pay a small premium for that trust or convenience or whatever else they are getting from it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you are making a new site and you don&#8217;t think you can be beat the incumbent (like for example if you are trying to compete with match.com which already has a ton of users and fairly decent site), then making your site &#8220;free&#8221; could be your best competitive advantage.</p>

<p>In summary, you have to offer SOMETHING better to get people to use it.  If you can&#8217;t offer a better service, then offer a better price (free).  Or do both.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This list might be a little different than the typical great business ideas you see talked about in major publications (like Facebook, the iPhone, etc).</p>

<p>Those are great ideas, but I prefer to look at business ideas which are a little closer to home.  Ideas that anyone with some hard work could get off the ground even if they didn&#8217;t have much money.</p>

<p>I like business ideas which&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have low startup costs</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t require manufacturing a physical product (like the iPod, which incurs huge overheads)</p></li>
<li><p>Actually charge something (unlike YouTube or more generally the &#8220;hope we get bought out by Google&#8221; business model)</p></li>
<li><p>Scale well and don&#8217;t <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/helping-individual-people-cant-make-you-rich/">require your personal time</a> for each person you help</p></li>
<li><p>Fit the lifestyle of &#8220;breaking free&#8221; by not trading time for money</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All of these ideas are somewhat obvious in hindsight, but I bet you can steal the &#8220;how&#8221; behind every idea and adapt it into a new business.  How they made something easier, cheaper, faster, etc and helped a whole bunch of people.</p>

<p>Here they are in no particular order&#8230;(and by the way, I either use or have used every single one of these at some point besides PlentyOfFish):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-3033696-10430552">Mozy</a></strong>
Mozy is an online backup service.  It automatically backs up the files on your computer over the internet, and offers unlimited storage space for a few dollars a month.  I like this business model because its a subscription product, solves a real problem (when your hard drive crashes, it HURTS to lose everything), and scales well.  You can build the system and it requires pretty much the same amount of investment whether 10 people use it or a million people do.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.universitytutor.com">UniversityTutor.com</a></strong>
Ok granted I might be a little biased since this MY site :)  But still, I like the idea because of the reasons mentioned above.  It&#8217;s a better solution to a common problem than what is currently out there (the common problem being, where can I find a high quality tutor for my child at a good price who lives near me?).  Super low startup costs and scalability are a plus here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.plentyoffish.com/">PlentyOfFish</a></strong>
PlentyOfFish is a free online dating site that is advertising supported.  The founder and sole operator, 29-year-old Markus Frind, runs the site from his West Vancouver apartment.  The site pulls in more than $5 million a year from Google advertising with only its one employee/founder.  Simply staggering.  More generally, I like this approach of taking an idea you already know works online (match.com, eharmony.com, etc), and make a free alternative to it that is advertising supported.  I&#8217;m sure their are dozens of opportunities that fit that model which are ripe for the picking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a></strong>
Basecamp is an online collaboration tool.  It was started by <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-secret-to-making-money-online/">just a few guys</a> working part time and is now a multi million dollar subscription product.  It worked because they went out of their way to understand good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design">user interface design</a> (something that, shockingly, Microsoft still sucks at).  They built a loyal following of people who were happy to find software that &#8220;just worked&#8221; (a rarity) and really saved them time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/wt">WordTracker</a></strong>
A tool for online marketers that lets you find out what your customers are typing into search engines to find you.  The product isn&#8217;t even that good, but considering how bad the alternatives are, the bar is pretty low (Yahoo deserves a particular dishonorable mention for the colossal wasted opportunity they had with http://inventory.overture.com, a similar site that is now offline).  Anyway, again it is a subscription product that scales well and solved a real need that people had.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/e-junkie">E-Junkie</a></strong>
The process of accepting credit card payments on your website is traditionally nothing short of a nightmare.  It involves horrible programming intricacies, laws and rules regarding encryption and storage, and having to deal with the shady credit card processing industry.  It used to be hard to get a nice looking shopping cart set up quickly but E-Junkie changed that.  It was surprisingly easy to get it set up on my website, and I&#8217;ve used many of the alternatives (OSCommerce, Zen Cart, buy now buttons, etc).  I&#8217;m going to start sounding like a broken record, but&#8230;.same reasons: subscription product, scales well, solves a real pain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.Lulu.com">LuLu.com</a></strong>
This one was probably more expensive to set up than others on this list, but its a great service for authors to get their books printed.  Just upload a word document or PDF and they will do drop shipping, manage inventory for you, and get your book on Amazon.com.  This company is making the idea of a publisher more obsolete (although that won&#8217;t happen completely for a while).  Its a godsend to first time authors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.lifestylesquest.com/quest/marketing/QuestInfo.aspx">Quest</a></strong>
This is a small local business in Houston, but I like the idea.  It saves realtors and real estate investors all sorts of time by make a simple interface to look up and analyze investment property.  Again, we see an improvement in user interface design which saves people time and makes their lives easier.  This little innovation is a neat little subscription product that costs about $75/month (almost pure profit and again scaleable).  At that rate you only need a little over a thousand customers and its a million dollar business.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Any time you see someone who is FRUSTRATED there is a business waiting to be born.  Just go ask people around the office or your friends &#8220;What is the most annoying part of your job?&#8221; or just watch them for an afternoon and you&#8217;ll see something they are doing inefficiently.  Any time you can save someone some time, money, or frustration you have a viable business idea.  Now if it <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/helping-individual-people-cant-make-you-rich/">scales well</a> you&#8217;re really on to something.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no better time than now to take the initiative and put one of these ideas together.  Hiring programers to make some software is <a href="http://www.guru.com">cheaper than ever</a>.  What are you waiting for?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you have noticed and emailed me about the &#8220;Top Commentators&#8221; section in the right hand sidebar of this website.</p>

<p>This is a list of people who have posted comments on the site, and as a bonus for commenting it gives the top 5 posters a link to their website (based on number of posts).  This link shows up on several hundred pages of this site including the Page Rank 4 homepage.</p>

<p>Its a great way to build traffic and ranking in search engines for your website.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also just email me a thoughtful relevant question that you really would like to know the answer to, and if I post the reply I&#8217;ll include a link to your site.</p>

<p>What ONE THING are you really dying to know, that would help you get a business started, quit your job, or get you on your way to financial freedom?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey Folks,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had some good success lately with Jeff Johnson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/jj">video distribution techniques</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago I made this little 2 minute video demonstrating my new site:</p>

<p>Then I targeted my most competitive keyword (&#8220;austin tutors&#8221;) by putting this in the title and tags of the video.</p>

<p>Then I went to put it online.  Normally I just upload my videos to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bdarmstrong1">YouTube</a> since this is the most popular site.  But taking Jeff&#8217;s advice, I uploaded it to <a href="http://www.tubemogul.com">Tube Mogul</a> instead, which automatically uploads it to about 10 different video sharing sites (including YouTube).</p>

<p>This in and of itself is pretty valuable because it takes the exact same amount of time to upload it to TubeMogul as it does to YouTube, except uploading it to TubeMogul gets you maybe 5x the distribution for the same amount of effort.  It would take me about 30 minutes per site to do it individually.</p>

<p>Heres the proof, it uploaded the same video to <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/watch/2694339/7862043">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=2111398470">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1322632/">MetaCafe</a>, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3160622116978808884">Google</a>, <a href="http://one.revver.com/watch/893892">Revver</a>, <a href="http://uncutvideo.aol.com/videos/5eec94461c496d1c85064746429ba7a9">AOL</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5gmq4">DailyMotion</a>, <a href="http://www.blip.tv/file/915336">Blip</a>, <a href="http://www.veoh.com/videos/v11368067n4J7bswD">Veoh</a>, and <a href="http://www.howcast.com/videos/9136-Austin-Tutors-Where-To-Find-the-Best-Tutors-in-Austin-TX">HowCast</a>.</p>

<p>Within 24 hours I was seeing some of these video pages show up in Google search results for &#8220;austin tutors&#8221; (most on the 2nd and 3rd pages).  Obviously Google likes these video sharing sites because normally my webpages would take 2 weeks to get updated by Google, but these were getting picked up within 24 hours.</p>

<p>One of them (the AOL video) got on the first page for a bit for my main keyword, then went back to page 2.</p>

<p>The next step was social bookmarking&#8230;</p>

<p>I added my video (the YouTube one) to a bunch of social bookmarking sites like Digg, Stumbleupon, and Delicious.  I actually did this at 32 different social bookmarking sites using a tool called <a href="http://www.socialmarker.com">SocialMarker</a>.  Now 24 hours later, the YouTube video is on the first page of Google (#5) for my main keyword &#8220;austin tutors&#8221;.</p>

<p>I have never seen results this fast!</p>

<p>Will it stay there?  I have no idea.  But still that is pretty impressive.  It&#8217;s almost as good as getting my actual homepage on the first page of Google because people will see the video as a testimonial I think and hopefully then go to the website.  I&#8217;m going to try bookmarking some other ones (and my main site) to see if I can get more on the first page.</p>

<p>Using this technique I think it would be possible to get a whole bunch of links on the first page of Google.  Still waiting to see if these results last though.  I hope so.</p>

<p>I had never heard of Jeff Johnson before this, but I&#8217;ll be <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/jj">keeping a closer eye on his stuff</a> from now on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121115437321202233.html">Wall Street Journal a few days ago</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The most compelling statistic of all? Half of all new college graduates now believe that self-employment is more secure than a full-time job. Today, 80% of the colleges and universities in the U.S. now offer courses on entrepreneurship; 60% of Gen Y business owners consider themselves to be serial entrepreneurs, according to Inc. magazine. Tellingly, 18 to 24-year-olds are starting companies at a faster rate than 35 to 44-year-olds. And 70% of today&#8217;s high schoolers intend to start their own companies, according to a Gallup poll.</p></blockquote>

<p>An upcoming wave of new workers in our society will never work for an established company if they can help it. To them, having a traditional job is one of the biggest career failures they can imagine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Hi Brian,
Any suggestions on how I would go about getting a mentor with a similar specialization that would be willing to help future competition?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
-Michele</p></blockquote>

<p>Hi Michele,</p>

<p>Just think about who is doing what you want to do already SUCCESSFULLY.  Then try to get their email or just show up if you have to and ask for 5 minutes of their time.  Tell them you&#8217;d like to get started and would appreciate any advice they could give.  Ask them how they got started when they were in your place.  Play to their vanity and desire to teach others.</p>

<p>If they are already successful they won&#8217;t care about creating competition because they&#8217;ll know competition is good for them and helping others is even more to their advantage.  If they do care about this then they are small time and you don&#8217;t want their advice anyway, trust me (you should run out the door).</p>

<p>They&#8217;ll probably give you some task (book to read, or put some plan together, etc).  Do it (this will prove to them you&#8217;re serious) and now you can check in with them later to show it to them.  Ask for the next step and do it.  Repeat, and you have a mentor.</p>

<p>Brian</p>
