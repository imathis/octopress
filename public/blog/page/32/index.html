  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is Day 9 of my 30 day <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">marketing challenge</a> to make a profitable blog website.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I installed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cache/">WordPress Cache</a> plugin so that the pages on this site will load faster.  I noticed it becoming a bit sluggish, and this seemed to have helped a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>I installed a bunch more 301 redirects to fix more <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-8-feedflares-reciprocal-links-broken-links/">broken links</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I started working off of <a href="http://www.aripaparo.com/archive/000632.html">this</a> list of blog search engines.  I submitted Breaking Free to almost all of them (some were dead links).  This will help generate more links to the site (to improve rankings in Google, the main benefit) and drive some traffic directly (secondary benefit).</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a great video that was posted on Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s blog which reinforces my main message:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I don&#8217;t believe in business plans</p></li>
<li><p>You probably don&#8217;t need venture capital</p></li>
<li><p>Just get started with something, and grow from there</p></li>
<li><p>If it doesn&#8217;t work out, you&#8217;ve lost nothing, and learned a valuable lesson</p></li>
<li><p>Your next try will be that much more likely to succeed</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s a discussion panel with 5 entrepreneurs who bootstrapped.</p>

<blockquote><p>Markus Frind, the founder of PlentyOfFish.com is my new hero (James Hong of Hot or Not is a close second). Marcus spends about two hours a day in his underwear managing a free dating website that gets twelve billion page views a year. He is the only employee, and he only has one server. And by the way, he makes $5-6 million/year with Google ads.</p></blockquote>

<time datetime="2007-06-25T17:38:56-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 25<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/813356_book_stack_11.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/813356_book_stack_11-150x150.jpg" alt="Books" /></a>Today, I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret that I use to read AT LEAST ONE BOOK EVERY WEEK, without taking any additional time out of my day.</p>

<p>But first, I&#8217;d like to take a minute to stress how important ongoing education is to your success, and why EVERY SINGLE SUCCESSFUL person I know focuses on it daily.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean the kind of education you got in school, in those dusty old text books that were full of numbers and boring graphs.</p>

<p>I mean a different kind of education that deals more with street smarts, than book smarts.</p>

<p>Did you know that the majority of people (58%) will NEVER read a book again after high school?  Our education system leaves such a bad taste in people&#8217;s mouths.  When we are forced to learn, we end up dreading the process, instead of embracing it.</p>

<p>I know that in my own life, it wasn&#8217;t until I was out of school that I really started to love learning.  I realized one day, that learning wasn&#8217;t just for reading, writing, and arithmetic.  You could literally learn how to do ANYTHING in life.</p>

<p>Whether you wanted to get in shape, become more creative, build wealth, or start a business&#8230;it is a LEARNABLE skill.</p>

<p>And you do it much the same way you learned in school.  You start by surrounding yourself with people who know more about the subject than you do.  Then you read, listen, and watch everything that they have to teach you.  Mimic the best until you reach a level of mastery where you can innovate on your own.</p>

<p>Once I realized the importance of learning I started trying to read more books about business.  The problem was that there was never enough time.  Sure, I could TRY to read a chapter per day, but the time would always be filled with something urgent, and the reading would never get done.</p>

<p>I literally had a STACK of books that I wanted to read, and wasn&#8217;t making much progress.</p>

<p>That is, until one day I discovered a secret to success, which I learned from a man named Brian Tracy.  The secret was to start listening to AUDIO BOOKS in my car while I was driving.</p>

<p>You see, every day I HAD to drive somewhere.  There was no way that I could forget to drive, or not have enough time to drive. Every day, I was going to drive somewhere no matter what, so it was BUILT IN to my life.</p>

<p>I eventually came to hear of more and more successful people, who ALL followed this strategy.  Pretty soon I was going through a book a week on tape.  I would even &#8220;read&#8221; books while I was at the gym, taking public transit, or flying (so even if you don&#8217;t drive, there are still opportunities).</p>

<p>For me, the real beauty of listening to books on tape is that I get to hear someone&#8217;s voice, and this is how I learn best.  It was like I was surrounding myself with these great authors. Everyday, their way of thinking and great outlook on life was changing the way I thought.  I heard their voices and ideas so much, it was like they were my personal friends who I couldn&#8217;t get away from!</p>

<p>Some people are audio learners, and learn best when hearing someone speak (like me).  Some people are visual learners, and learn best when they can SEE the words on the page (the next post in this series will offer some tips for you).  A small percentage of the population are even touch learners, and learn best when moving their body or using their hands.</p>

<p>If you learn well by listening or hearing words in any way shape or form, then audio books are the secret you&#8217;ve been missing to start learning more every day, without taking any additional time out of your day.</p>

<p>Life is quite simply TOO SHORT to spend listening to Britney Spears and Snoop Dogg on the radio.  Instead, start getting more reading done then you ever thought possible today by listening to audio books.</p>

<p>A great first one to listen to is Brian Tracy&#8217;s, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743526589?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0743526589">The Psychology of Achievement</a>.</p>

<p>You can get audio books through services such as <a href="http://www.audible.com">www.audible.com</a> (the Amazon.com of audio books), which allows you to download MP3&#8217;s to burn to CD&#8217;s or to use on your MP3 player.</p>

<p>They are often a bit cheaper than the actual book.  You can also get audio books for free at your local library, and find some online for free.  Finally, I have a handful of friends who also listen to audio books and we always share.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the next two posts in this series which will contain TWO MORE SECRETS you can use to get more learning done every day, without taking additional time out of your day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s day 8 of my 30 day <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">marketing challenge</a> to drive more traffic to this website!</p>

<p>By the way, I realize that the nitty gritty technical details of this process may not be interesting to everyone.  Even if you aren&#8217;t the type of person who would do this yourself, my goal is just to prove that blogging can be a simple and profitable business to start.  You could hire someone to go through this entire 30 day process for very little money.  Its the idea of getting a business started that I want to impress upon you.</p>

<p>Today&#8230;
1. I added <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.feedburner.com%2Ffb%2Fa%2Fpublishers%2Ffeedflare%3Bjsessionid%3D0111D8BC426030BA9FD78969E56CF95A.fb1&amp;ei=1ft-RpDOBJeQggTQl7WfAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEplseOtAo8-HiTxAUZEh7bN-CImw&amp;sig2=0pb-dVCBKLwxvvOWkFmDRw">FeedFlares</a> to the bottom of posts (both in RSS and single post pages on this website).  This allows users to submit the page to Digg, De.licio.us, and StumbleUpon (all popular Web2.0 sites) as well as email the article to a friend.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I added about a dozen new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_links">reciprocal links</a> through a program I installed previously called, <a href="http://www.linkmachine.net/trk.php?ID=2328">LinkMachine</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I installed a plugin to email me whenever someone tries to access a broken link on this website.  You can find the plugin on <a href="http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress">this</a> page.  Given my recent site overhaul and all the changes I&#8217;ve been making, there were a lot of broken links and my inbox was quickly filling.  This was a big area to improve, because I had no idea how much traffic I losing just to broken links.  It&#8217;s a shame to go to all the work to market your site only to have people come and leave right away seeing a 404 page!  So I did two things.  I setup a more friendly 404 error page that allows people to search for what they were looking for (instead of the standard 404 page of death).  Secondly, and more importantly, I started adding <a href="http://www.isitebuild.com/301-redirect.htm">301 redirects in a .htaccess file</a> based on the emails coming in (sounds complicated I know).  Basically, a fancy way of saying that when a user came to the site to a page that no longer existed, they were automatically sent to the right page.</p></li>

<time datetime="2007-06-25T00:35:51-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 25<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Skip Tierno is a self-employment counselor and business coach with The Entrepreneur&#8217;s Source, North America&#8217;s leading business and franchise consulting organization.</p>

<p>The Entrepreneur&#8217;s Source has been helping people achieve self-employment for over twenty years and was ranked among the top consulting franchises in the country by Entrepreneur Magazine.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/ericbanner_entrepreneur1.gif" alt="The Entrepreneur’s Source" /></p>

<p>I recently got the chance to ask Skip a few questions&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>What is the best and worst part of owning a business that most people don&#8217;t realize?</strong>
The best part of owning your own business is your ability to directly affect the results in terms of income, profit, cash flow, as well as your own personal lifestyle such as flexible hours.The worst part is that it still takes a lot of work to be a business owner. Those that are not promoting and marketing their business are relegating themselves to working in the business and thus they just bought themselves a job. Said differently, you get what you put into the business.</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>Looking at either perspective, as a franchise owner you need to follow the proven system and success will follow.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>In your experience, how long does it take new business owners to match or exceed their previous income in a typical 9-to-5 job? </strong>
It certainly depends on what their previous job/career was and what business they now own. But on average, 12-18 months if it is a new franchise. (Note: I like many other Franchisors do not make earnings claims) A purchase of an existing franchise could shorten that timeline to 6-12 months.For a start-up businesses from scratch, statistics show that it takes 3 years to reach positive cash flow and thus much longer to match or exceed previous income.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What would you say to someone who would love to work for themselves, but has a family to support and is concerned about the risk?</strong>
The facts show that 70% of the population has a strong desire to be self-sufficient, but only a small number actually find a way to make it happen. Too many people give up on their dreams too soon, when education and guidance could show them the way to success.Within the first two meetings we discuss the issues of Fear and Risks. These range from affordability to fear of failure to the fear of making a mistake. After these are on the table, we talk about them in depth to understand if they can be mitigated effectively. For instance, when someone wants to get a loan for their business we recommend having 6-12 months living expenses factored into their business plan. My role is to coach my clients through their fears so they are comfortable in their journey of discovery. One of the key areas I address up front is risk and if it is too great to overcome for the client I will recommend they wait or address the risk before continuing to explore business ownership.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If only more people knew [blank] they wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to start their own business. What is that blank?</strong>
If more people knew the Facts and Information about business ownership they wouldn’t hesitate to own their own business. Our human nature allows our perceptions and emotion create the myths and misconceptions about business ownership. My coaching provides a fact based system for my clients so they can make a well informed decision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Entrepreneur&#8217;s Source seems to specialize in the franchise area. For a first time business owner, what are the main benefits of going the franchise route? </strong>The Entrepreneur’s Source, <a href="www.TheEsource.com">www.TheEsource.com</a>, has been ranked in the Franchise 500 for the past 9 years.</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>The benefits of a franchise are :


* Franchises have been operating for over 30 years and are represented in over 75 industries. That equals brand recognition.



* Franchisors look for those people who want to be in the business of business and not the technicians.



* Franchises are regulated.


* Franchises provide a proven system and training and ongoing support.


* Franchising provides a structure, a proven way of doing business so that franchisees can concentrate on marketing, promoting and managing the business.


A recent Price Waterhouse Cooper study showed there are over 750,000 franchised businesses generating over $1.5 trillion to the US economy.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Can a franchise owner still have the lifestyle they love? I&#8217;ve heard that they work 12 hour days just to keep the shop open!</strong>
 We recommend to all of our clients to read the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0887307280?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0887307280">The Entrepreneur Myth</a>by Michael Gerber. This addresses the issue of working &#8220;in&#8221; the business vs. working &#8220;on&#8221; the business.By working with a coach to find the business to match their goals, needs and expectations, a potential business owner will know before they own the business what their hours will be and the lifestyle they will be living.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can you tell us about a recent client you worked with and how they accomplished their goals of self employment? </strong>
 Certainly! Recently a person who was employed by a reputable company came to me and indicated that he was going to be downsized in 3 months. He wanted to explore business ownership and take control of his destiny. After working through our process of our educational and validation compartments he explored 3-4 business models and reached clarity on an existing franchise that was up for sale. We coached him through the business plan and negotiations, pointed him in the direction of legal and financial resources and by the 6th month he was a business owner. In fact, in just 4 short months he has nearly doubled revenue for his business. That is a success story! In fact I have a vested interested in my clients success and I stay in touch with them routinely to provide support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I&#8217;m not sure what type of business I should start. Where can I get some ideas?</strong>
 I recommend that you should start by doing a self-assessment from the inside out. Specifically, what are your goals, needs and lifestyle desires for the next 3, 5, 10 years out. Include financial, family, health, community and other areas in your assessment. Then start thinking about types of businesses. In the meantime visit <a href="http://www.franchisesearch.com">www.franchisesearch.com</a>to look at specific businesses and industries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I&#8217;m already swamped at my current job and don&#8217;t have much time on weekends. Do I have to quit to transition into self-employment? </strong>
 Not at all! In fact there are businesses and franchises that are synergistic with having a full time job. Being an absentee or semi-absentee owner can be as fulfilling as being a full time owner of a business.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What books (or other educational products) do you recommend to your clients?</strong>
Additional books/tapes that I recommend are :</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think the email subscription is going out too often: every evening.</p>

<p>While this content is hopefully useful to readers, you are probably a lot like me: busy, inbox overflowing, and lots of things to read.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to send out updates perhaps every 3 days, but currently <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/">FeedBlitz</a> doesn&#8217;t offer this.  For right now I&#8217;ve set it to go out once per week on Wednesday, but I may be able to adjust it further in the future.</p>

<p>The update emails will be longer, but then you can skim for articles that catch your eye.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/mybloglog1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/mybloglog1-150x150.png" alt="MyBlogLog" /></a>This is day 7 of my 30 day <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/16/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">marketing challenge</a>.  Today&#8217;s ideas come mostly from John Reese&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.income.com/blog/2007/06/12/calling-all-seo-super-geeks/">here</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I adjusted my link structure to be a simpler format: &#8220;/postTitle/&#8221; instead of what it was &#8220;/year/month/day/postTitle/&#8221;.  Supposedly this will help search engines pull keywords out of the links by making them shorter and the directory structure smaller.  I used <a href="http://www.deanlee.cn/wordpress/permalinks-migration-plugin/">this plugin</a> to make sure I don&#8217;t break any links in the transition.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a big list of &#8220;update services&#8221;.  Updated services are websites that get notified (pinged) each time you make a post on the blog.  Here are the ones I added:
http://rpc.pingomatic.com/
http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping
http://api.moreover.com/ping
http://api.feedster.com/ping
http://api.moreover.com/RPC2
http://api.my.yahoo.com/RPC2

http://xmlrpc.blogg.de/
http://thingamablog.sourceforge.net/ping.php
http://blogsearch.google.com/ping/RPC2</p></li>
<li><p>I submitted the site to <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/">MyBlogLog</a> and tagged it with the right keywords.  This (in theory) allows a community to develop around your blog where people will say they like your blog and will share it with others.  I don&#8217;t know much about it but it was recommended.  It comes with a little snippet of code you can use on your website that shows who has viewed the site recently.  I couldn&#8217;t format it correctly on my site so I removed it.  Hopefully it can still be used without the snippet of code installed (this is what I assume, but can&#8217;t say for sure).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I wanted to also try changing the hyphens in my link structure to underscores too, but was unable to find a way to do this.</p>

<p>Here is what I did today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Added an email signature to my outgoing emails. (see picture)  I send a lot of emails each day, so hopefully this will reach some new people.  As will all good marketing, I tried to include a benefit to the reader to get them to take action (in this case, click the link).</p></li>
<li><p>I submitted an article to <a href="http://blogcarnival.com">BlogCarnival</a> so that it could be included in one of their pages.  BlogCarnival is a website where people compile lists of related blog posts into more useful collections.</p></li>
<li><p>I submitted a link to this post series on building traffic to <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a>, which is another Web2.0 site with lots of traffic.  Once they approve my link, I&#8217;ll probably spend $50 to drive 1000 hits to the site (5 cents per click) and see how many convert to subscribers.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are subscribed by email and have seen some strange problems lately, I apologize.  It is my fault.</p>

<p>In the process of switching to FeedBlitz as our newsletter provider, there have been some difficulties.  I think FeedBlitz could improve their interface here and there, but ultimately it&#8217;s my fault for not making you the readers aware of the changes.  So please bear with me as I get them worked out.</p>

<p>More companies could probably avoid disaster and improve customer relations with that simple phrase: &#8220;I apologize, that is my fault&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-111.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-111-150x150.gif" alt="First Page of Google Results" /></a>This is day 5 of my 30 day <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/16/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">challenge</a> to build build traffic to this blog.</p>

<p>As a side note, I achieved two top ten rankings on Google!  I am #8 (first page) for both keywords &#8220;start home business&#8221; and &#8220;start home based business&#8221;.  This is huge, and is the result of some SEO work that I paid a guy to do about a month ago.  I found him on <a href="http://www.elance.com">eLance.com</a>, and from what I understand he accomplished this mostly through paid links.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been getting about 800-1000 visits per day the last few days, and subscribers are up to 792 after taking a major dip due to my switch to FeedBlitz and some technical problems.</p>

<p>Here are the three tasks I accomplished today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Spent a number of hours fixing bugs on the website.  There was a bug in the email newsletter that went out.  My apologies for that, I&#8217;m working to fix it.  There was also a bug with the contact form on this page now showing up which I was finally able to resolve.  These are not the sort of traffic building activities I want to be spending my time on, but it&#8217;s important to have a working website before sending more people to look at it.</p></li>
<li><p>Since most of my traffic so far has come from being a contributing editor on lifehack.org, I decided to see what other contributing editor positions I could get at other blogs.  The more traffic the better, so I went to Technorati&#8217;s <a href="http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/">top 100 blogs</a> page and looked for related blogs.  I sent in requests to lifehacker.com (different than lifehack.org, but much more traffic), http://searchengineland.com, and http://www.problogger.net/.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote another article for LifeHack.org which will be posted soon.  You can see the last article I wrote for them <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/power-napping-how-to-fall-asleep-anywhere.html">here</a>.  It generated more comments than any other article I&#8217;ve seen recently.</p></li>
</ol>
