  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogging is great and I always enjoy giving my thoughts in these articles.</p>

<p>But I know there are plenty of experienced entrepreneurs who read this blog who have their own important view points.</p>

<p>Sure, we get a little bit of discussion in the comments, but it is mostly just me talking AT you instead of a real back and forth conversation.</p>

<p>Well no longer!  Today I&#8217;m introducing the <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/forum/">Breaking Free forum</a> which will be located at:  <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/forum/">http://www.startbreakingfree.com/forum/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/forum1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/forum1.png" alt="The Breaking Free Forum" /></a></p>

<p>I used the <a href="http://www.fahlstad.se/wp-plugins/wp-forum/">WP-Forum plugin</a> for Wordpress to get this installed in case you would like to put something similar on your blog.</p>

<p>I tried to do a few things differently&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>There is no registration required to post.</strong><br/>
I&#8217;m a big believer in reducing all possible barriers for people.  I hate it when I stop by a site and want to drop a quick response and they ask for registration.  It&#8217;s not worth the time and I don&#8217;t want them emailing me in the future so I just give up!  Not requiring registration was also a big part of Wikipedia&#8217;s success I believe, since they allowed anyone to edit an article even if they didn&#8217;t have an account.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I tried to start small with a very limited number of categories.</strong><br/>
I think people try to overdo it sometimes by making dozens of different topics in a forum</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Forum posts could turn into blog articles.</strong><br/>
I will of course still be making blog posts.  But occasionally I will take interesting threads from the forum and highlight them here on the blog.  If yours gets picked up I will make sure to highlight your name and website.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You can get incoming links to your site by participating.</strong><br/>
If you do decide to register on the forum, you can create a &#8220;signature&#8221; that shows up at the bottom of your posts and includes a link to your website.  People who post deserve to be rewarded for their efforts.  I won&#8217;t use a &#8220;nofollow&#8221; tag or anything like that to block Google from following the links.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It will be a place to network and meet other entrepreneurs</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve created a section called &#8220;Introduce Yourself&#8221;.  Here you can post a link to your business or website (free advertising!) and also include what city you are physically located in.  This will hopefully be a great place to meet other entrepreneurs.  The more like-minded people you can get around, the faster you will reach your goals.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, I really think the forum will help take this site to the next level.  It will turn Breaking Free into a real <em>discussion</em> where anyone can participate instead of just one man&#8217;s point of view.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s How You Can Help Us Get Started</strong></p>

<p>Think of the one question or problem that is bothering you that if you could just solve it, it would help you get your own business started in the next year or take your existing business to the next level.  Then <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/forum/">post in in the forum</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be personally answering questions there on a regular basis and may phase out the contact form entirely in the future.</p>

<p>Also take a moment to <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/forum/">introduce yourself and your business/website</a> to rest of the Breaking Free readers.</p>

<p>See you in the forums!
Brian</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Part of the reason I blog is to build <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-build-brand-equity/">brand equity</a>.</p>

<p>Call me narcissistic, but I think it&#8217;s important to control what comes up when someone Googles your name.  People decide all sorts of things about you by Googling you.  Business deals, speaking opportunities, and (if I cared about such things) getting a job can all be determined by your results in Google.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/tnaqu81.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/tnaqu81-150x150.jpg" alt="Loser Brian Gerard James" /></a>Until recently, what came up first in Google when I searched for &#8220;Brian Armstrong&#8221; was this clown.  A two bit, WWF wrestler named Brian Gerard James.</p>

<p>You got that right, he isn&#8217;t even named &#8220;Brian Armstrong&#8221;!  Apparently that is one of his &#8220;ring names&#8221; along with &#8220;The Dark Secret&#8221; and &#8220;The Road Dogg&#8221; with two g&#8217;s.  LOSER!  How lame does this guy have to be to STEAL my name (and Snoop Dogg&#8217;s double g&#8217;s) just to sound cool.  Everyone knows the WWF isn&#8217;t even a real sport!</p>

<p>Anyway, this has been bothering me for some time.  And luckily, my day of reckoning has finally come because the last time I Googled my name, StartBreakingFree.com now ranks above the so called &#8220;Road Dogg&#8221; Brian Gerard James.</p>

<p>Good bye Mr. James, you just got a straight up &#8220;Google Piledriver&#8221; from the REAL Brian Armstrong.  If you even had a blog, my blog would kick it&#8217;s ass.</p>

<p>What comes up when people Google YOUR name?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Breaking Free reader Rui writes in with the following question&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Can you suggest where to get help in order to develop a business plan?</p></blockquote>

<p>Hi Rui,</p>

<p>What most people mean when they talk about business plans is a 25 page document with lots of fancy stuff like an executive summary, break even analysis, excel graphs, and market segmentation.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#8217;m not a big fan of these.  I wrote one back in 2004 for my tutoring business and I think they are bullshit for one primary reason: almost everything I predicted in it turned out not to be true.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nothing more than guess work and it turned out to be a pretty big waste of time.</p>

<p>One of my pet peeves about people starting businesses is that they spend way to much time THINKING and not enough time DOING.  I fell into this trap too.  You don&#8217;t need to guess if something is going to work and model it in Excel when you can just do it and find out for real!</p>

<p>This is why I&#8217;m a big fan of finding <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">quick and inexpensive ways to try out new business ideas</a>.</p>

<p>Instead I suggest you do a quick and simple business plan which answers some key questions and makes some rough estimates.  Preferably, it should be drawn on the back of an envelope with lots of scratching things out, and it shouldn&#8217;t take more than a few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Here is an example of a good business plan:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/biz-plan-example1.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/biz-plan-example1-150x150.gif" alt="Two Minute Business Plan" /></a></p>

<p>Some things I like to jott down and think about:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can it help a TON of people (estimate some revenue #&#8217;s to help yourself get excited)</p></li>
<li><p>Does it scale well (i.e. is it passive, does it require my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/helping-individual-people-cant-make-you-rich/">personal time to help each additional person</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>If it really took off, would it fit into my lifestyle and would I enjoy it?</p></li>
<li><p>Would it be fairly quick and inexpensive to test out the idea (this is important since <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/9-businesses-i-started-which-utterly-failed/">9 out of 10 of my ideas don&#8217;t work</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Does it have a high profit margin (this covers up mistakes and keeps you out of commodity businesses where you can only win on price, a bad place to be!)</p></li>
<li><p>Can I do significantly better than solutions that already exist out there (a quick Google search usually answers this)</p></li>
<li><p>Can I sum up the biggest benefit (or value proposition) of this business in one sentence?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I think all great business ideas can be summed up in one sentence.  Play around with it at the bottom of your &#8220;business plan&#8221;.  If you can&#8217;t get it into one concise, clear sentence, you probably don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing yet.</p>

<p>If it seems to have promise, then take a night to sleep on it and then get to work building it!  Don&#8217;t give yourself a chance to fall into &#8220;analysis paralysis&#8221; where you eventually end up doing nothing on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed watching <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=79141131942029098&amp;ei=cFXkSJi-G4TyqAPgjpzWDw&amp;q=warren+buffet+business">this talk by Warren Buffet</a> last night.  I hope you get a chance to watch it as well.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some of my favorite parts (paraphrased)&#8230;</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>If you had to pick one person who you&#8217;d get 10% of their income for the rest of their life, who would you pick?  You wouldn&#8217;t pick the person with the highest IQ, you wouldn&#8217;t pick the person who got the best grades in business school.  You&#8217;d pick the person who had the qualities you like.  The person you trust, who showed up on time, the person who gave credit instead of trying to take it.  None of those qualities are difficult to have, you can just decide to be that kind of person.</p>

<p>Peter Lynch has always said, buy a business that&#8217;s so good that any idiot can run it, because sooner or later one will.</p>

<p>A kid from Harvard asked who he should go work for.  I told him he should go work for whomever he admired the most.  A couple of weeks later I got a call from the Dean, he said &#8220;what&#8217;d you tell these kids?  They&#8217;re all becoming self-employed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leave your children enough money so that they can do anything, but not so much that they can do nothing.</p></blockquote>

<time datetime="2008-10-01T02:38:41-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 1<span>st</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you know, I recently started a new <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">passive income business</a> that went from conception to launch in just one month.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-generate-leads-to-your-new-website/">last article</a> I briefly mentioned how I was able to start getting some great organic search results (that means free traffic from search engines that I don&#8217;t have to pay for!).  I&#8217;d like to share with you today how I did that.</p>

<p><strong>The Power Of Having Keywords In Your Domain Name</strong></p>

<p>From prior experience I knew the power of having keywords in your domain name.  For example <a href="http://www.houstonfinancetutor.com">this site</a> ranked #1 in Google for my primary keyword &#8220;houston finance tutor&#8221; and &#8220;finance tutor houston&#8221; in just 20 days with ZERO other marketing.  The only reason it ranked there was because my keywords were in the domain name: houstonfinancetutor.com.</p>

<p>Following this same logic, I launched the new tutoring site with a separate domain for each region.  Here are some of the ones I chose:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>www.austin-tutor.com</p></li>
<li><p>www.new-york-tutor.com</p></li>
<li><p>www.tutors-boston.com</p></li>
<li><p>www.philadelphia-tutor.com</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s worth noting here that each site had separate content and separate tutors on it.  If you are thinking of duplicating your site across multiple domains to rank in search engines, don&#8217;t do it.  It won&#8217;t work because search engines are pretty good at detecting duplicate content.  They will just pick one copy and discard the rest.  But that wasn&#8217;t the case here&#8230;.I had separate tutors on each site generating separate content.</p>

<p>I chose these domains after using the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal">Google Adwords Keyword Tool</a> to see what people were searching for.  As expected, many people living in a particular city were doing &#8220;regional&#8221; searches for a tutor.  In other words, they were including their city name in the search as opposed to entering a generic term like &#8220;algebra tutor&#8221;.</p>

<p>The &#8220;regional&#8221; searches were much less competitive terms to rank for on Google, so I figured I had a good shot of getting on the first page of Google for some of those terms.</p>

<p>How did it work?  Pretty well.</p>

<p>Within a week or two I was getting first page Google listings for some of the less competitive keywords like &#8220;biology tutor austin&#8221; or &#8220;latin tutor austin&#8221;.  If you know anything about search engine optimization, then you know for a brand new site to get first page listings in Google in a few weeks is pretty outstanding.</p>

<p>However, I was NOT yet getting on the first page for more competitive terms like &#8220;algebra tutor austin&#8221; (a more popular subject) or &#8220;austin tutor&#8221;.</p>

<p>There were also several other problems, most notably that I had to manage and market many separate sites now.  I had to try and get incoming links to each one, register each one, set up my software to work with each one, etc.  Plus they weren&#8217;t the most prestigious looking domains, given that they had hyphens in them.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords In A Subdomain</strong></p>

<p>For the reasons mentioned above I decided to combine all my sites into one domain: www.UniversityTutor.com</p>

<p>This would make it easier to manage, but then I would lose the benefit of having my keyword (city name) in the domain, right?</p>

<p>To fix that I decided to use regional subdomains just like <a href="http://houston.craigslist.com">houston.craigslist.com</a> or <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com">houston.citysearch.com</a>.</p>

<p>Now my domains would look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>austin.universitytutor.com</p></li>
<li><p>newyork.universitytutor.com</p></li>
<li><p>boston.universitytutor.com</p></li>
<li><p>philadelphia.universitytutor.com</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Having a subdomain with your keyword in it doesn&#8217;t give you quite as big of a boost in search results as having a domain with your keyword, but it is still much better than not having it at all.</p>

<p>Plus I figured the other benefits of the new setup made up for anything that was lost:  I would now have a professional looking domain without any hyphens, the domain had been around a long time and wasn&#8217;t &#8220;brand new&#8221; in Google&#8217;s eyes, and now all my marketing (and incoming links) could be directed to one site instead of being divided up.</p>

<p><strong>Managing the Transition</strong></p>

<p>I certainly didn&#8217;t want to lose all the rankings I&#8217;d already obtained with the old sites, so I had to manage the transition closely.  A special thanks goes out to my friend Josh at <a href="http://www.spotonseoservices.com/">Spot On SEO</a> who shared some of his wisdom.  He was great, so <a href="http://www.spotonseoservices.com/">give him a call</a> if you need any help with search engines.</p>

<p>It turns out you can use something called a &#8221;<a href="http://www.webconfs.com/how-to-redirect-a-webpage.php">301 redirect</a>&#8221; to tell Google (and other search engines) when you are moving to a new domain.  It took some technical mumbo-jumbo, but I eventually got them set up correctly.</p>

<p>So how well did it work?  Well I tracked the results, and here are my search engine rankings comparing the old sites (with separate domains) to the new site (using subdomains) after about two weeks.  The dashes represent not ranking anywhere in the top 500.</p>

<p>By the way, the tool I used to track these is called <a href="http://tools.seobook.com/firefox/rank-checker/">Rank Checker</a>.  It&#8217;s a free Firefox plugin and I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Overall the trend was very positive and it was a great improvement in keyword rankings!  I imagine many of the ones that did not improve will get picked up in the next week or two as Google catches the last of them.</p>

<p><strong>Some Final Tweaks</strong></p>

<p>Now that I was using subdomains, it meant I could expand to new cities much faster.  I didn&#8217;t need to hunt for an available domain name for each one!</p>

<p>I now had an incredible opportunity.  I had about 40 &#8220;subjects&#8221; in my database that someone might need a tutor in (everything from Chinese to organic chemistry).  I then added about 1,000 cities into the database (along with about 2,000 universities that I could get tutors from).  I actually entered these by hand, and yes it was a really boring experience.  But hey, if you want to get ahead in life sometimes you have to make sacrifices!</p>

<p><strong>I now had the potential to create a huge number of targeted pages.</strong></p>

<p>Remember that my keywords generally followed the format of &#8220;[SUBJECT] tutor [CITY]&#8221; like &#8220;algebra tutor austin&#8221;.  Well with 40 subjects and 1,000 cities, I could now create 40 x 1,000 = 40,000 potential keywords to rank for.</p>

<p>The beauty of the site is that THESE PAGES ARE CREATED AUTOMATICALLY when a new tutor signs up in a given city and chooses a subject.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The title tag of the page is automatically generated to say &#8220;algebra tutor austin&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>An H1 tag, bold tag, etc is automatically generated to say &#8220;algebra tutor austin&#8221; somewhere on the page</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, the URL comes out to be http://austin.universitytutor.com/algebra which contains all the keywords!  &#8220;algebra&#8221;, &#8220;tutor&#8221;, and &#8220;austin&#8221;.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are just a few of the things that search engines look at.  If you want to see a more complete list of all the factors search engines look at to &#8220;rank&#8221; a page, <a href="http://www.webconfs.com/15-minute-seo.php">check out this link</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully these factors will all come together to get some great search engine rankings across a very wide spectrum of pages as more tutors sign up.  Currently there are 1,759 pages on the site and Google is still catching up, having only indexed 273 of them so far.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen search engine traffic start to go up already, but I hope to be bringing in thousands of visitors per day (free!) from organic search results in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>This may be a bit out there for some people, but hopefully it at least gives you an idea of what is possible, especially if you have a regional business.  (Feel free to ask questions below, I&#8217;m sure I skipped some important details).</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re just getting started with a new site, I think the biggest thing you can take away is this: if you choose a domain (or subdomain) with your primary keyword in it, it can really help you rank for that term in search engines.</p>

<p>Finally I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has been buying <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">my book and sending in your kind words</a>.  I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled that you are finding it useful!</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know about you but I&#8217;m pretty glad the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/careers/work/la-fi-bailout30-2008sep30,0,6407711.story">House rejected the government&#8217;s $700 billion dollar bailout</a>&#8230;.at least for now.</p>

<p>The Fed needs to focus on it&#8217;s job of controlling the money supply and inflation and stop using OUR money to bail out failed companies.</p>

<p>$700 billion is a lot of money.  Do you realize there are only about 300 million people in the U.S.? I&#8217;m just guessing but maybe 200 million of those are 18 years or older and pay taxes.</p>

<p><strong>700 billion divided by 200 million = $3,500 per tax payer.</strong></p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=700+billion+divided+by+200+million&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">Google it</a> if your calculator doesn&#8217;t have enough digits.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never had anything to do with Lehman Brothers, personally I&#8217;d rather keep my $3,500.  It&#8217;s not like their customers will be left out in the cold.  Someone will come along and buy them up on the cheap.  It will be too good of a deal not too.  Lehman will be screwed (and they deserve it, they took the risks) but the economy as a whole will end up fine.  After all, people still needing banking services, and someone will be there to provide it.</p>

<p>What do you think, do you mind the government using $3,500 of your money to bail out some executives who made bad decisions?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I told you about how I tested a whole bunch of <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-evolution-of-a-business-model-never-stop-testing/">different business models</a> in my new passive income business.</p>

<p>At each step of testing I had to send some traffic to my website to see how people would respond.  Today I&#8217;d like to show you some different ways I got traffic to my site, and how to measure their effectiveness.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/09/dashboard11.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/09/dashboard11-150x150.png" alt="New Tutors" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Step 1 - Google Adwords</strong></p>

<p>In the first business model when I was charging clients, I got started by driving some traffic with Google Adwords.</p>

<p>There are a million ways to drive traffic, but Google Adwords is one of the first places I recommend people start.  You can literally get a targeted ad in front of millions of people in about 10 minutes.  It knocks the socks off traditional print or television advertising which typically takes months (not minutes) and isn&#8217;t targeted at all.  You know someone reading &#8220;Car and Driver&#8221; magazine is generally interested in cars, but you know far more about someone who just typed &#8220;Nissan 350z road test&#8221; into Google.</p>

<p>Anyway, I digress.  I bid on some keywords like &#8220;math tutor&#8221;, &#8220;biology tutor&#8221;, etc and used Google to geographically target people who lived in a certain area where I was testing (geographic targeting is another thing that is much easier online).</p>

<p>For each click I had to pay about $0.50.  Since the average sale on my website was for about $10, that meant I had to turn at least 1 out of 20 people who came to my site into a customer.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how the math works to determine that:</p>

<p>$10 / $0.50 = 20</p>

<p>That means $10 in advertising will get 20 people to your website.  If 1 out of those 20 people generates $10 in profit for you then you have &#8220;broken even&#8221;.  You have spent $10 and made $10.</p>

<p>If you can get past &#8220;breaking even&#8221; in your marketing, you have done a truly magical thing.  After all, if every time you spent $10 you got back more then $10, how many times would you do it?  You would never stop!</p>

<p>This whole idea of have a &#8220;marketing budget&#8221; as an expense (which most big companies follow) is a mistake.  People who consider marketing an expense are just not tracking their conversions properly.  They are guessing.  Your marketing budget should provide a measurable ROI, or you shouldn&#8217;t be doing it, period.</p>

<p>Anyway&#8230;</p>

<p>1 / 20 = 5%</p>

<p>That means I needed a minimum 5% conversion rate to make this advertising method viable.  If I could turn 5% of the website visitors into customers, it would pay for itself.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cost per click: about $0.50</p></li>
<li><p>Break even conversion rate: 5%</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately for me, I did not quite achieve 5%.  I can&#8217;t remember exactly now, but I think it was closer to 2%.</p>

<p>To remedy this I could attack the problem from two angles: find a cheaper source of leads or turn more people into customers!  I started by trying to find cheaper clicks.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 - Facebook</strong></p>

<p>Eventually I started getting a lot of free &#8220;client&#8221; leads through organic search results (which is a topic for another post) and I also <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-evolution-of-a-business-model-never-stop-testing/">switched the business model over to charging tutors</a> instead of clients.</p>

<p>That meant my &#8220;leads&#8221; now were tutors.  I turned to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ads/">Facebook</a> because I knew tons of college students used it and those were the tutors I wanted to hire.</p>

<p>Facebook&#8217;s advertising system is very well done, and allows you to target people geographically, by school, by keyword, etc.  Another bonus is that they are less well known and less competitive compared to Google Adwords, so the clicks were cheaper: about $0.22.</p>

<p>By the same math as above&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cost per click: about $0.23</p></li>
<li><p>Break even conversion rate: 2.2%</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You notice that the cheaper my clicks, the lower the conversion rate I need to break even.</p>

<p>This was great, now my break even rate was starting to come in line with my actual numbers.  Keep in mind also that the tutors here were paying a <em>monthly</em> subscription price of $10, so I had to look at the payback period.</p>

<p>If I looked at a 1-month time frame, a sale would bring in $10.  But if tutors subscribed for many months then it would bring in even more.  I didn&#8217;t have any good data yet on how long tutors would stay subscribed, so I decided to take the most conservative approach of look at a 1-month time frame.  Obviously, if it made sense that way, it would be even better over longer periods of time.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 - Student Job Networks</strong></p>

<p>Facebook was working pretty well, but I wanted to continue my search for new sources of leads.  By looking at the career services page on a number of university websites, I discovered that many of them use a service provided by an outside company to keep track of their student jobs.</p>

<p>It was free to post a job at one school so I tried it out.  The response from students was good.  Unfortunately it was tedious to create an account and fill out forms at each individual school.</p>

<p>Luckily the job network sites (there are several bigs ones as I discovered like <a href="http://www.collegegrad.com/">CollegeGrad.com</a>, <a href="http://www.nacelink.com/">NACELink</a>, and <a href="http://www.experience.com/">Experience.com</a>) offered a paid option that would allow you post your job to ALL the schools in their network.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tested out one of them so far (NACELink) and the results have been good with their bulk rates.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cost per click: about $0.14</p></li>
<li><p>Break even conversion rate: 1.4%</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I will continue testing other methods of bringing in leads of course, but there are a few important takeaways from this I think.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are tons of sources of leads out there.  Never stop searching for new advertising opportunities!  Sacrifice early profits and test a lot to find the rights ones early on.</p></li>
<li><p>Your goal is to reach and go beyond the &#8220;magic&#8221; place where each lead you bring in pays for itself.  Once you achieve this there is no limit to how much you can spend on those leads.</p></li>
<li><p>There are only two ways to get there: find cheaper leads or raise your conversion rate</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, it&#8217;s interesting to note that of the two, raising your conversion rate is far more powerful.  Why?</p>

<p>Because if your site converts with the expensive leads then it will also convert with the inexpensive leads.  That means you can use ALL sources of leads to grow your site that much faster.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been working on <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-split-testing-your-sign-up-page-can-double-your-results/">raising the conversion rate as well</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully this sheds some light on how to get early visitors to your website.  Until next time, keep breaking free!

<p>P.S. You may have noticed that Google un-banned my Adsense account after my appeal.  Thank you Google!  I still have no idea how it happened, but let&#8217;s hope it doesn&#8217;t happen again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you don&#8217;t know who Gary Vaynerchuk is.  He runs the very successful <a href="http://tv.winelibrary.com/">Wine Library TV</a> which gets something like 85,000 readers per day.</p>

<p>He is one of the rare bloggers who has managed to get on/in the Wall St. Journal, GQ, Time, Conan, Ellen, etc.</p>

<p>His style is irreverent and he isn&#8217;t afraid to tell it like it is.</p>

<p>Here are two talks he has given about how important it is to build brand equity.  Brand equity is how well you are recognized in people&#8217;s minds.  Yes YOU can and should be a brand.</p>

<p>Brand equity can weather any recession, can launch any company, and can open doors for you around the world.</p>

<p>The beautiful part about technology (the internet, videos online, blogging, etc.) is that it has leveled the playing field.  You no longer need to live in LA or New York to get discovered.  You no longer need a huge marketing budget.  You no longer need contact in mainstream media (tv, radio, print, etc).  Now ANYONE with talent than can rise to the top regardless of where you start.</p>

<p>Check out these two inspiring videos from Gary, and get to work today on building YOUR brand equity:</p>

<p>On another note.  I really need to start going to some of these conferences.  It&#8217;s amazing what getting around liked minded people can do to help propel you to the next level.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you may remember how I took a passive income idea and <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">launched it in one month</a>.</p>

<p>Since then I&#8217;ve been revising and testing out different business models as it slowly builds momentum.  There are now about 300 tutors signed up and over 600 &#8220;matches&#8221; have been made (between a tutor and student).</p>

<p>I thought you mind find it useful to see some of the ideas I&#8217;ve tested along the way, including what worked and what didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.universitytutor.com"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/09/ut-homepage1-150x150.gif" alt="Find A Tutor" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Version 1 - Charge the Client</strong></p>

<p>When I first started out I figured it would be hard to find good tutors and easy to find people who would want to hire them.  So I decided to charge clients for the service of finding a good tutor.</p>

<p>This is the model used by sites like monster.com or &#8220;recruiting&#8221; sites.  The employer pays to find the employee, not the other way around.</p>

<p>I bought a bunch of traffic and drove some people to the site with Google Adwords, but after testing this for a while it became clear the the conversion rate was not very high.  What was the problem?</p>

<p>After thinking about it for a while I came to the conclusion that I was asking people to pay <em>too soon</em>.  I think people wouldn&#8217;t mind paying for a tutor once they were convinced they had found someone who was good.  But to ask them to pay for the opportunity to contact some tutors&#8230;who may or may not work out, didn&#8217;t connect with people.</p>

<p>I would have preferred to only charge them AFTER they found a good tutor and had met with them, but I couldn&#8217;t think of any way to enforce this in my passive model.  I mean, what incentive would someone have to come back and pay after they had already met with the tutor and had all their info.  It just seemed like a hassle and annoyance.</p>

<p>Even though I had a money back guarantee, etc, I had to admit that clients weren&#8217;t going for it.  I had to face facts: the people on the site weren&#8217;t convinced of the value at the time I was asking them for their money.</p>

<p>So what to do&#8230;give up?  No!  Try another approach to accomplish your goal.  That&#8217;s the mark of a successful entrepreneur.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2 - Charge the Tutor</strong></p>

<p>After thinking some more about <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-model-breakdown/">different business models</a>, I decided it might work better to charge the tutors to keep a profile on the site.</p>

<p>After all, they were the ones who stood to benefit by earning lots of money.  In general, very few people have a problem with someone saying &#8220;hey if I were to bring you a huge pile of cash, would you mind if I took a little off the top for myself&#8221;.  In other words, I only get paid if you get paid.  It&#8217;s a great sales proposition.</p>

<p>Furthermore, charging the tutors made much more sense as a recurring &#8220;subscription&#8221; product because tutors would need to get new jobs on an ongoing basis (there is a high turnover).  Selling to clients would be a one time sale but selling to tutors would be recurring revenue.</p>

<p>Yet, I still had the issue of asking tutors to pay up front before they really knew if it would work.  This was just some average looking site they stumbled across, and as with everything online it&#8217;s hard to know <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-launch-preview-part-2-how-to-build-trust-online/">what you can trust</a>.  Clearly, I needed some sort of free trial.  I decided to test out a standard &#8220;30 day free trial&#8221;, after which I would ask tutors to subscribe if they wanted to keep their profile up.</p>

<p>So what happened?  A pitifully low conversion rate. :(</p>

<p>Of the 78 tutors who registered in one month, only 1 converted into becoming a subscriber.  At that rate, it wouldn&#8217;t cover the cost of bring in leads (a topic for my next post).</p>

<p>So what to do&#8230;give up?  No!  Try another approach to accomplish your goal.  That&#8217;s the mark of a successful entrepreneur.</p>

<p><strong>Version 3 - Trick Them Into Paying</strong></p>

<p>At this point I contemplated various other schemes that might help improve the conversion rate.</p>

<p>One tactic often employed by companies (Netflix for example) is to require the credit card details up front on a 30 day free trial.  That way if the person doesn&#8217;t cancel within 30 days they get charged instead of having to actually enter their payment info at the end of the 30 days (a big difference psychologically).</p>

<p>This always seemed shady to me since if your site is really worth it people should be willing to pay.  You shouldn&#8217;t need to trick them, rely on their laziness, or hope they forget to cancel.</p>

<p>But I tested it anyway just to see what happened, and it didn&#8217;t work very well.  Even with all the right &#8220;marketing tactics&#8221; in place, hardly anyone who went to the sign-up page actually signed up once they saw a credit card was required.  Plus I didn&#8217;t really feel good about requiring it in the first place.</p>

<p>I was thinking about it all wrong.  Instead of focusing on how to convince people to sign-up, I should have been thinking about how to make the site better!</p>

<p>At this point, I was getting somewhat discouraged.  What kept me going was one important fact: PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY FINDING THE SITE USEFUL.  I knew this because every day tutors were finding jobs on the site and people were finding tutors.  I would occasionally get emails from people telling me how much they liked the site.  This thing had potential, I could feel it.  I was probably even a little bit <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/09/irrationally-co.html">irrationally committed</a>.</p>

<p>So what to do&#8230;give up?  No!  Try another approach to accomplish your goal.  That&#8217;s the mark of a successful entrepreneur.</p>

<p><strong>Version 4 - A Better Free Trial</strong></p>

<p>I could have always just made the site free and put up some advertisements, but I knew there was a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>After discussing this dilemma with other entrepreneurs, I finally went back and looked at the data from the free trial (version 2).  A startling fact emerged: only 25% of the people who had gone through the 30 day trial had been contacted by ANYONE.</p>

<p>That meant that 75% of the people who I was emailing saying &#8220;hey your free trial is up, pay me money!&#8221; had never even been contacted for 1 tutoring job.  No wonder they weren&#8217;t signing up!</p>

<p>Still, I figured that if 25% of people had gotten a job, and doing only 1 hour of tutoring covered the cost of subscription, at least more of those 25% would have subscribed, right?</p>

<p>I decided to survey that 25% and sent them a very brief, personalized email from me.  Not some mass mail that would get deleted.  It looked like this&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Test,</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m surveying a few of the tutors, and was hoping you could send me some feedback on your experience so far with UniversityTutor.com? Basically, has it been useful and if so how? If there is any way we can improve the site or make it better please don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback I appreciate it!

<p>The responses I got back painted a clear picture: most of that 25% who had gotten contacted had only been contacted by 1 person.  Often, that one contact hadn&#8217;t even turned into a job for them.  Essentially, I was over-estimating the value of being on the site.  I wasn&#8217;t giving them any real value (they hadn&#8217;t gotten a tutoring job) so they had no reason to subscribe.</p>

<p>It finally made sense.  You need to get in touch with several potential clients (not just one) before you get a real tutoring job out of it (I knew this from experience but didn&#8217;t connect it).  Plus, many people who came to the site would contact 4 or 5 tutors all at once and wait to see who got back to them promptly.  Basically, they were interviewing several tutors for one job, so getting 1 contact through the site did not guarantee a job.</p>

<p>This was further confirmed when I went back and looked at the one person who had subscribed.  They had been contacted more than anyone else that month: 5 times.</p>

<p>I thought for a few days about how to make the site better so people could clearly see the benefit before I asked them to pay.  I thought about extending the free trial to 60 days or just focusing on SEO to bring in more traffic.</p>

<p>Then something hit me:  why not make the free trial based on the number of contacts instead of the length of time.  Sure, a 30 day free trial was common, but maybe it didn&#8217;t make the most sense in this case.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong>:  I changed the free trial so that the first 5 students who contacted you were free, no matter how long that took.  No credit card was required up front.  I also cut the subscription price in half from $19.95 to $9.95.</p>

<p>The number of subscribers improved almost overnight.  It was a great feeling.  I felt like I had cracked the code.  I literally did a dance around the computer.</p>

<p>Now, when someone received an automated email from me asking them to subscribe, I KNEW they had at least been contacted by 5 people and could see the value in the site.  Maybe that would take 2 months to happen.  Maybe it would take 2 weeks as the site got more popular.  This felt right, and the tutors seemed to agree.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I think there are several important take aways from this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/9-businesses-i-started-which-utterly-failed/">9 out of 10 of my ideas don&#8217;t work</a>, and that&#8217;s ok</p></li>
<li><p>Survey your customers, they will tell you what&#8217;s wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t ask your prospects to pay until AFTER they&#8217;ve seen the value</p></li>
<li><p>REMEMBER: So you want to give up?  No!  Try another approach to accomplish your goal.  That&#8217;s the mark of a successful entrepreneur.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Hey Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I know you&#8217;ve thought a lot about investment / passive income, etc. so I wanted to get your thoughts&#8230;</p>

<p>I can see how real estate is a great investment if you can get someone else (a renter) to pay the entire mortgage for N years, and then you sell for a profit and you make money. Maybe you can even rent it for more than that and make money every month.</p>

<p>But what about when you can&#8217;t rent it for that much? In a few years I will probably move out of my condo, so I need to think about whether to keep it as a rental. Total cost per month that we&#8217;d still owe with a renter (mortgage, property tax, and condo fee) is about $2200/month. And I honestly don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d be able to rent it for more than $1900/month.   Maybe rents would go up in 10 years. But the condo fee would also go up over time.</p>

<p>To make money, the value would have to increase faster than inflation.  Anyway I&#8217;m just curious what you think!
K</p>

<p>Hi K,</p>

<p>Good thoughts all around.  Negative cash flow properties can still make sense.</p>

<p><strong>On the plus side&#8230;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t forget a small part of your mortgage payment is going to pay off the principal (maybe $100 on yours per month?) and that is really your money, it&#8217;s no different than putting $100 in a savings account each month except it&#8217;s equity in the house which you will eventually get back in a refinance or sale, so while I wouldn&#8217;t count it as cash flow, it&#8217;s also not money spent in your -$300, it&#8217;s money saved.</p></li>
<li><p>Real estate gives you tax benefits&#8230;all the interest payments, improvements to the house, and property taxes are deductible, some other stuff too like people calculate travel mileage.  It adds up quick, I ended up taking a huge deduction in taxes from real estate last year.  People who own lots of real estate get away with murder regarding the tax system in this country.  Some of them are millionaires and qualify for wellfare because they show such low income, and it&#8217;s perfectly legal.  So that&#8217;s one other side benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>I wouldn&#8217;t worry about the inflation part of it, real estate automatically adjusts for it (both rents and values).  When people talk about appreciating values or rent going up they mean above and beyond inflation, so yeah I don&#8217;t think real estate ever loses value to inflation the way cash would since rents and home values are liquid markets just like any other good.  Most leases I&#8217;ve seen have an automatic price bump built in each year for inflation, as an example.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>On the negative side&#8230;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t forget to include cost of insurance in your cash flow (although that may be part of the condo fee?)</p></li>
<li><p>You&#8217;re right condos aren&#8217;t ideal because they can assess greater fees whenever they want</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s a pain just in answering phone calls from tenants and repairs once in a while, and when someone moves out you have to use their deposit to get it ready again, etc.  Your time is certainly worth something.  What works out best I think is pricing the rent slightly below market so you get lots of rental applicants, then you can run credit checks (and criminal) on every applicant (costs about $15 each) to make sure you really find a good tenant who will stay in there forever and treat it well.  I also have a home warranty policy which covers most repairs so they can just call that number instead of me, costs about $350 per year in Houston, but of course there are always little unexpected surprises so owning real estate is never stress free.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s not an easy decision, but if it were me I would probably keep it unless you have an immediate need for the cash.  In the long term real estate is always a good investment.  Many people inadvertently wind up millionaires just because every time they move they don&#8217;t sell their old house, they rent it.  And for sure that thing will be worth millions some day, hard to say when, but your mortgage isn&#8217;t getting any bigger so you know that.  Rich people all own loads of real estate, so I say the more of it you can get your hands on the better.</p>

<p>Good luck, and until next time, keep breaking free!
Brian Armstrong</p>

<p>P.S.  Also, one more thing&#8230;to get your cash out of it, you don&#8217;t necessarily have to sell it.  You can refinance it out and still have the asset plus rent coming in.  Some people say never sell a piece of real estate since you can refinance the money out and it will keep paying you both in rent and equity build up.</p>
