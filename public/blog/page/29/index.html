  <div class="entry-content"><p>Question from a reader:</p>

<blockquote><p>Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I am loving the book for its inspiration as I have been contemplating quiting my job. I have more than sufficient $ to take some time off, so last Friday I went ahead and put in my two weeks. It&#8217;s a scary feeling to do this especially without a side business already up and running, but I can afford it. Do you know of a good resource to use to come up with business ideas?</p>

<p>Best,
A.V.</p>

<p>A.V.,</p>

<p>Great question, and one that is on many people&#8217;s minds.  Here are some ideas in no particular order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Look at what frustrates you.  Whats annoying.  Whats hard to use.  Imagine you go to a restaurant to meet a friend.  But you get lost on the way, the waitress forgets your order, and the table you are sitting at wobbles.  Three annoyances, and three businesses exist to solve those problems.  They are all around you!</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of things probably frustrate you, but pay attention to what frustrates other people.  Where you can solve someones pain, there is great money to be made.  Keep a journal and write down any time you see someone get upset for a week.</p></li>
<li><p>Type into Google &#8220;entrepreneurs [your city name]&#8221; and join at least one club in your city.  Most large cities have some sort of entrepreneurship organization that meets regularly (could also be indirectly related such as networking, marketing, etc).  Some cost a little money, some are free.  Whatever, join them.  Getting around like-minded people is priceless, and will get your brain thinking in totally new ways.  If you can&#8217;t find any club, join <a href="http://mindpetals.com/blog/2007/07/five-reasons-all-entrepreneurs-should-join-toastmasters/">Toastmasters</a>.  In any given week, I attend at least three such clubs.</p></li>
<li><p>Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005R8BQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00005R8BQ">Business 2.0</a>.  It&#8217;s actually dangerous for me to read it because by the time I&#8217;m done, I&#8217;m ready to drop everything I&#8217;m doing and launch my next great project.  It&#8217;s way better than Entrepreneur Magazine, Forbes, Money, and Business Week combined.</p></li>
<li><p>Go talk to the retired executives at <a href="http://www.score.org">SCORE</a> (it&#8217;s free) and stay in touch with them by email.</p></li>
<li><p>Find someone who owns their own business and is rich.  Call them on the phone and ask for 10 minutes of their time.  If you don&#8217;t get a call back, just show up at their office (really!).  Be honest and tell them you have no idea what you&#8217;re doing, but you want to start a business.  You&#8217;d be surprised how willing people are to help, especially older folks.  Just ask them how they got started, and they&#8217;ll talk for hours.  If their advice is helpful, do what they say, and call them again a week later to go over it.  Make it a regular thing, and you&#8217;ve got a mentor.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask everyone you meet &#8220;So have you ever thought about starting a business?&#8221;.  Most people have ideas even if they&#8217;ll never do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the written exercises in Chapter 5 of <a href="/breaking-free/">Breaking Free</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Get involved in the business school at your local university.  They often have events such as business plan competitions, guest speakers, and networking functions.  Most events at business schools have great receptions afterwards with free alcohol.  If you give an MBA candidate a couple beers, he or she will tell you their business ideas for the rest of the night.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit with a blank sheet of paper in total silence for an hour, with &#8220;what is my purpose?&#8221; at the top and see what happens.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I&#8217;ve done all of these at some point, and still do many of them.  Hope it helps!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/eeducation1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/eeducation1-150x150.png" alt="Entrepreneurship Education Wikipedia" /></a>This is day 29 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new traffic to this website.  It&#8217;s been a long journey and it&#8217;s almost done demonstrating that <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">blogging can be a profitable and inexpensive business to start</a>!</p>

<p>Here are my three tasks for the day&#8230;</p>

<h3>1. Contributed to &#8220;Entrepreneurship Resource&#8221; Directories</h3>

<p>I started off today by doing a google search for &#8220;entrepreneurship resources&#8221;.  One of the best results I found was this page on <a href="http://www.zeromillion.com">Ryan Allis&#8217; Zero Million site</a>.  So I submitted a few articles that I&#8217;ve written.</p>

<p>By the way Ryan is a master of building website traffic as you can see by his outstanding rankings in Google.  He wrote a free <a href="http://www.zeromillion.com/pdf/building-links.pdf">eBook on the subject</a>, and while I think his strategy worked for him (basically email website owners and asking for links, on a mass scale), it&#8217;s probably not as effective today.  Website owners have seen too many link request emails like and consider it spam at this point.</p>

<p>Try typing &#8220;[your industry] resources&#8221; into Google and see where people are looking for good content.</p>

<h3>2. Answered Some Questions on Yahoo Answers</h3>

<p>I decided to answer some <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070718210826AACZVpl&amp;r=w&amp;pa=FZptHWf.BGRX3OFMiTBdUoo8nvX9RYQNpMU64Kp_lK48o_6l0g--&amp;paid=answered#RpxsDzS1LUzneUZZquaU">questions</a> on Yahoo Answers.  This is good way to help people and you can also include your link!</p>

<h3>3. Wikipedia</h3>

<p>Google loves Wikipedia links (you see them ranked highly in all sorts of search results).  So I decided to see if there was a legitimate reason to add my website into a Wikipedia article.  Just adding it haphazardly won&#8217;t help because Wikipedia has such a large community of people patrolling their articles that irrelevant links will be removed within a few hours.</p>

<p>So anyway, I found this article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship_education">entrepreneurship education</a> and added the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>There are also non-profit organizations such as SCORE, government programs such as the Small Business Association, and blog websites.</p></blockquote>

<p>I included references to SCORE, the SBA, and my website.  I&#8217;m actually surprised it didn&#8217;t have that information in the article about SCORE and the SBA.  Those are both great resources.  We&#8217;ll see if it stays in or gets edited out.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/amazonbooks1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/amazonbooks1-150x150.png" alt="Breaking Free Appeared on Amazon.com Today" /></a>This is day 28 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new visitors to this website.  I also want to demonstrate that <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">starting a blog can be a profitable and inexpensive business to start</a>.</p>

<p>My three tasks for the day are&#8230;</p>

<h3>1. Updated Information On Amazon.com</h3>

<p>My <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">book on how to start a home based business</a> finally appeared on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Free-Perfect-Business-Opportunity/dp/1430307870/ref=sr_1_1/104-9160704-8211906?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1184702611&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon.com</a> today.</p>

<p>The images didn&#8217;t show up however, and the formatting of the text could use some work, so I spent some time correcting it.  The text hasn&#8217;t updated yet, but the new images are there.</p>

<h3>2. I Created a &#8220;Listmania&#8221; on Amazon.com</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=cm_lm_create_help/104-9160704-8211906?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=14279651">Listmania</a> lists on Amazon represent a marketing opportunity (I got this idea from Yanik Silver by the way).  I titled the one I created &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R26UGMUBHP2IEF/ref=cm_lm_pthnk_view/104-9160704-8211906?ie=UTF8&amp;lm%5Fbb=">How to start a business</a>&#8221;, and it not only includes my book, but many other <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/3/ref=pd_ts_b_nav/104-9160704-8211906?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=left-1&amp;pf_rd_r=0T397NFGPWBX86TMRFAS&amp;pf_rd_t=2101&amp;pf_rd_p=221591101&amp;pf_rd_i=51546011">popular business books</a> that are out right now.</p>

<p>If I add the most popular business books to my list, that means I get to capitalize on the tons of traffic they are getting because my listmania shows up on each of their pages.  I think my listmania list to gain some popularity though before it will start showing up.  Amazon seems like it is only showing the top three for now, but I think the idea is solid even if it doesn&#8217;t work right away.</p>

<h3>3. Changed the Sub-title of the book on Amazon</h3>

<p>Notice that I also changed the sub-title of the book from &#8220;Fire Your Boss, Toss Your Alarm Clock, and Double Your Income With An Easy Transition Into Self-Employment&#8221; to &#8220;How To Work At Home With The Perfect Small Business Opportunity&#8221; for the Amazon copy.</p>

<p>Why did I do this?  Keywords.</p>

<p>People search Amazon just like they search Google, and based on the keyword research very few people search for terms like &#8220;breaking free&#8221;, &#8220;fire your boss&#8221;, or &#8220;self-employment&#8221;.</p>

<p>I want my book to come up for the most popular searches on Amazon, so I put some popular keywords in the sub-title such as &#8220;work at home&#8221;, &#8220;small business&#8221;, and &#8220;business opportunity&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/752454_headphones_11.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/752454_headphones_11-150x150.jpg" alt="Listening To Audio Books Is A Huge Boost In Productivity" /></a>This is day 27 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new readers to this blog, and demonstrate that blogging can be a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">profitable and inexpensive business to start</a>.</p>

<p>I skipped two days in the challenge because I decided to go a seminar on real estate investing for the weekend.  It was all day both days and I was just too tired to do anything else by the time I got home.  The seminar was awesome and I&#8217;ll be posting some more about it in the future.  To be honest, I&#8217;ve been having trouble thinking about anything except what I learned over the past few days, and have already started taking action.</p>

<p>Another interesting note: I am now #12 on Google for the keyword &#8220;home based business&#8221;.  Just last week I was #14 (and it fluctuated after that, going as high as #16).  First page (top ten) here I come!</p>

<p>Here are my three tasks for the day&#8230;</p>

<h3>1. I wrote a new article for LifeHack.org</h3>

<p>Since my contributing author positions tend to bring in the most readers to this site, I&#8217;ve written another article for LifeHack.org on the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-education-how-to-devour-at-least-one-business-book-per-week-without-taking-any-additional-time-out-of-your-day/">importance of listening to audio books</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Removed Translation</h3>

<p>Based on the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-25-translated-into-8-languages-a-version-for-mobile-devices-and-submitted-to-dozens-of-blog-directories/">website translation feedback</a> I got, I decided to remove the Google translation links from this website.  Apparently the translations were just too poor to be useful, and it was taking up prime real estate (see!) in the sidebar.</p>

<h3>3. Handed out more business cards</h3>

<p>Finally, I met about six people over the past two days who were somehow involved or interested in entrepreneurship and gave them a card.  Not only that, but I got their card as well.  This is extremely important because I&#8217;ve noticed that people love to exchange cards, but only a small percentage ever follow up.</p>

<p>In other words, it&#8217;s up to YOU to follow up with them.  The number of people who will take you card and actually visit the website or contact you is pitifully small.  When I contact them I usually try think of something that would be useful to them, and I don&#8217;t write anything about my website.  I include it in the footer, and usually just because I had mentioned it to them previously, they will visit the website.</p>

<p>This is key, because you aren&#8217;t pushing it on them and writing to say &#8220;by the way check out my website!&#8221;  People&#8217;s immediate reaction is to run away when you do that, because they think you must be selling something.</p>

<p>Step 1: get their card, don&#8217;t just give yours
Step 2: follow up as soon as you get home, don&#8217;t delay
Step 3: offer value to them by talking about what they want, not what you want.</p>

<p>My three tasks for the day were&#8230;</p>

<h3>1. Added This Website To More RSS Directories</h3>

<p>I finished submitting to the <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/rss-blog-directories/">pages on this list</a>.  There were a lot and it took a long time.</p>

<h3>2. I Attended A Business Networking Event For Rice University Alumni</h3>

<p>This was a great event to meet people of all ages from my university, <a href="http://www.rice.edu">Rice</a>.  Some had graduated this year, and some had graduated 40 years ago.  This was a good chance to use my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-17-posted-interview-audio-faster-server-and-new-business-cards/">business cards</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I followed up with a number of people by email, and included my link in the email.</p></li>
<li><p>I made a contact with one guy who is in the business of helping others start companies.  There is a potential for partnering here in a number of contexts.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Take advantage of your universities networking groups!</p>

<h3>3. Updated the Alexa Screenshot</h3>

<p>The Alexa screenshot of the blog was out of date, showing my old site before it was even a blog.  Since this image is used by Technorati, BlogCatalog, and others, it was important to get it right.</p>

<p>It was easy to to, just check out this <a href="http://thumbnails.alexa.com/update_thumbnail">Alexa Submission Form</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/japanesewebite1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/japanesewebite1-150x150.png" alt="Google Translations On My Website" /></a>It&#8217;s day 25 of my 30 day marketing challenge to demonstrate that anyone can start a blog, and it can be a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">profitable and inexpensive home based business to start</a>.</p>

<p>Today I went to a <a href="http://www.small-business-consultants.net/small_business_resource/Internet_marketing_clinic.htm#class-schedule">free marketing class at the University of Houston</a> taught by Dick Myers and Jay Mock.  I couldn&#8217;t believe how much useful information I got.  I&#8217;ve been reading a ton about internet marketing, especially lately, so I thought I knew it all.  But these guys had some great ideas that I haven&#8217;t seen talked about elsewhere.</p>

<p>Jay runs an <a href="http://www.residential-landscape-lighting-design.com/">outdoor lighting and light fixture</a> store that gets a staggering amount of traffic.  Dick Myers also has an excellent <a href="http://www.small-business-consultants.net/blogs/">Internet Marketing Blog</a> that you should check out.</p>

<p>All three ideas for today came from the presentation.  I&#8217;ll probably go back each week.</p>

<h3>1. Translation</h3>

<p>Using <a href="http://www.google.com/translate_t">Google&#8217;s Translation service</a> I was able to get my entire website translated into 8 languages!  Check out the collection of flags in the sidebar on the right.  Here&#8217;s how&#8230;</p>

<p>Here is the code I used that you can paste into your own website.  Note that you will have to find and replace &#8220;www.startbreakingfree.com&#8221; with your own domain for it to work.  I had to modify the code <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/11/add-google-translation-flags-to-your.html">here</a> because I couldn&#8217;t get it to work on my site.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com%2F&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;langpair=en%7Cfr"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/43/1633/320/13539949_e76af75976.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<a href="http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com%2F&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;langpair=en%7Cpt"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/43/1633/320/13539966_0d09b410b5.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
<a href="http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com%2F&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;langpair=en%7Ces"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/43/1633/320/13539946_2fabed0dbf.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>I wanted to find a place to put those flags closer to the top of the page, but I couldn&#8217;t think of a good place.</p>

<p>This is great because supposedly, 65% of people on the internet speak a language other than English.  This dramatically increases the reach of this blog!  I image that while most internet users speak at least some English, this will allow them to get more out of it in their native language.</p>

<h3>2. Setting Up Access For Mobile Devices</h3>

<blockquote><p>Researchers at IDC say that 1.3 billion people will connect to the Internet via mobile phones by 2008.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/cellphoneemulator1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/cellphoneemulator1-150x150.png" alt="Cell Phone Emulator" /></a>Want to see what your website looks like in someone&#8217;s mobile device, like their cell phone?  Check out this <a href="http://emulator.mtld.mobi/emulator.php">emulator</a>.</p>

<p>This will also greatly increase the reach of the website.  I used <a href="http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/readme?project=wordpress-mobile-edition">WordPress Mobile Edition</a>, a plugin by Alex King, to get it up and running.  It took about 2 minutes to install and bam, I have a mobile version of this website.  Man I love WordPress and all the plugins people have made for it.  I have about 30 installed now.</p>

<h3>3. Submitting to RSS Directores</h3>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/blog-directories1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/blog-directories1-150x150.png" alt="RSS Directories - Great Places to Submit Your Blog" /></a>Based on Jay&#8217;s advice (and the presentation of one other gentleman, who&#8217;s name I can&#8217;t remember).  I decided to submit my site a a bunch of <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/rss-blog-directories/">blog directories</a>.</p>

<p>This took a long time but it should generate a lot of back links, because these sites will pull your feed and hopefully create webpages from it that contains your links.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d encourage anyone reading this to try and find a similar class or club in your area.  Just getting around all those people who were doing what I&#8217;ve been trying to do was amazing.  I left feeling really inspired and excited (and got 3 killer ideas).  That high can be more motivating than any other thing you do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/keyword-searches1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/keyword-searches1-150x150.png" alt="Keyword Search Popularity Is Not Always What You Might Think" /></a>This is day 24 of my 30 day challenge to bring new visitors to this website and demonstrate that blogging can be a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">inexpensive and profitable business to start</a>.</p>

<p>My three marketing tasks for the day were&#8230;</p>

<h3>1. Keyword Research</h3>

<p>I was checking up on my search engine rankings today and I noticed for the keyword &#8221;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=home+based+business&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=l5g&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N">home based business</a>&#8221; I am now #14 in Google.  Just two days ago I was #15.  I&#8217;m moving up!  Getting on the first page (top ten) will mean a big traffic increase.</p>

<p>Two important things I discovered were that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People don&#8217;t search for what you think they search for</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s best to target less competitive keywords when first starting out</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just to give you an example, when I was brainstorming what keywords to target for this site, I came up with some like &#8220;entrepreneurship&#8221; or &#8220;start a business&#8221;.  Well it turns out that apparently very few people search for these terms.</p>

<p>If you check out the chart, it shows an estimate of how many clicks per day you&#8217;ll get from being on the first page of Google for various keywords (I used <a href="http://www.wordtracker.com/">WordTracker</a> and <a href="http://inventory.overture.com">Overture</a> to come up with these results).  As you can see, keywords like &#8220;start a business&#8221; are dwarfed by keywords like &#8220;home business&#8221;.</p>

<p>I never would have guessed this.  The lesson here is spend the time to research your keywords.</p>

<p>So just because a keyword gets lots of clicks, does it mean you should target it and try to get your page on Google for that keyword?  No.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s unrealistic to target the most popular keywords when you are first starting out.  This is why I took some of the easier targets like &#8220;start home business&#8221; (currently #8 in Google) and &#8220;how to start a business&#8221; (currently #19 in Google).</p>

<p>Getting to #14 for &#8220;home based business&#8221; is a huge accomplishment because that is a highly competitive keyword with tons of searches.  It is already bringing in more traffic than &#8220;start home business&#8221; where I&#8217;m on the first page.</p>

<p>Anyway, what I realized is that I should make a push to move up in the rankings for &#8220;home based business&#8221; because I&#8217;m quite close already.  This means trying to incoming links with that in the anchor text and making out going links with that in the anchor text.</p>

<h3>2. Submitted 14 more link requests through <a href="http://linkmachine.net">LinkMachine</a></h3>

<p>I also changed the settings so that my anchor text would include &#8220;home based business&#8221; more often.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m making sure to only swap links with relevant sites as well (I&#8217;ve turned down a bunch) because I don&#8217;t want to get flagged by Google.</p>

<h3>3. Submitted Two More Articles To <a href="http://www.articlemarketer.com/">ArticleMarketer</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/lifehackarticles1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/lifehackarticles1-150x150.png" alt="Popular LifeHack Articles on Power Napping and How To Design A Nap" /></a>So far my two most popular articles (as tracked by Google Analytics) were about <a href="http://lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/power-napping-how-to-fall-asleep-anywhere.html">Power Napping - How To Fall Asleep Anywhere</a> and <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/how-to-design-the-perfect-nap.html">How To Design The Perfect Nap</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, I made the anchor text of the byline include the keyword &#8220;home based business&#8221;.</p>

<p>Since they were popular, I decided to give them a wider distribution through Article Marketer.  Maybe they will go viral!</p>

<p><strong>Discussion question:</strong> what keywords related to your niche do you think would be the most popular?  Make a guess and then visit <a href="http://inventory.overture.com">Overture</a> for a minute and see if you are correct.  Let us know the results in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/resizephp1.jpeg" alt="Seth Godin" />It&#8217;s amazing what you can do once you have a following and you are a brand.  For example, <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/daylongseminar/">you can decide to answer some questions one day and earn $50 grand</a>.  That&#8217;s part of the reason I&#8217;m creating this blog: to build myself as a brand.  Everyone should focus on building themselves as a brand.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s lots of marketing authors, but only one Seth Godin.
There&#8217;s lots of real estate Guru&#8217;s, but only one Trump.
There&#8217;s lots of pretty girls, but only one <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&amp;entry_id=18043">Paris</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever it is that you do, probably plenty of other people do it as well.  So if you want to earn more for an hour of your time, your name has to be worth something.</p>

<p>Do you have a desire to be known in your field?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/aboutpagew41.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/aboutpagew41-150x150.png" alt="A New About Page - Making A Good First Impression" /></a>This is day 23 of my 30 day marketing challenge to demonstrate that <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">blogging can be a profitable and inexpensive business to start</a>.</p>

<p>Today I started reading through Matt Huggins awesome list of <a href="http://www.matthuggins.com/55-essential-articles-every-serious-blogger-should-read">55 essential articles every blogger should read</a>, especially the section on Increasing Traffic &amp; Retaining Readers.</p>

<p>One thing I realized while reading CopyBlogger.com is that they have a great sense of design.  Contrast <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/five-steps-to-a-truly-unique-blog-that-works/">this page</a> for example to some of my previous posts.  It&#8217;s just so clear and readable, and beautiful.  I&#8217;m no designer, but one thing I realized is that I need to make subheadings for my 3 points bigger and bolder.  So I&#8217;ll try that on my post today.</p>

<p>My three marketing tasks for the day were&#8230;</p>

<h3>1. Rewrote the About Page</h3>

<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/whats-your-blog-really-about/">this article on about pages</a> and realized that mine could use some work.  It contained lots of info, but wasn&#8217;t captivating.</p>

<p>I decided to write it more as a story about me (people can&#8217;t help but listen to stories, it&#8217;s the most basic form of human communication) that ended with a call to action (subscribe!) and you can check out the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/about/">latest version here</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/old-about/">old one for comparison</a>.</p>

<p>Quick poll: do you think it will improve or reduce the % of people who subscribe from that page?  By how much?  I&#8217;ll post the results in a few days. (Post your answer in the comments.)</p>

<h3>2. I finished the article for ProBlogger.net</h3>

<p>I finished the article from yesterday about the confusion over RSS and sent it to Darren so see if he wants to post it.  I think the article turned out way better having written it, then let it sit for a day, before making the final version.</p>

<h3>3. Comments</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping up answering comments on this site.  I&#8217;m thrilled to see that we&#8217;re getting some real discussion.  It let&#8217;s me know that this experiment is working!</p>

<h3>Other thoughts:</h3>

<p>At some point I should probably write a <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/viral-copy/">viral eBook</a> which will take a bit longer than one day, but I imagine it would be quite effective.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve always struggled to explain working for yourself to other people.  Some just instantly &#8216;get it&#8217; and some don&#8217;t really see the point.</p>

<p>I think Jeremy Shoemaker hit the nail on the head with his post on <a href="http://www.shoemoney.com/2007/07/04/freedom-or-security/">Freedom vs. Security</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all it is, which do you value more?  Clearly I&#8217;m a freedom person, but I see now that entrepreneurship just wouldn&#8217;t make sense to someone who values security above all else.</p>

<p>To me this was the best part though:</p>

<blockquote><p>I was talking to a friend who owns several local businesses the other day about this very thing. We both kind of agreed its a awesome thing that there are so many security people out there who are satisfied to work 9-5 and make their owners (or stockholders) rich.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t willing to take the risks, then it&#8217;s tough to get the rewards.</p>

<p>I love it when a simple theory can be used to sum up a complex idea.  Which do you value more freedom or security?</p>
