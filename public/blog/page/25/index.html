  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey Folks,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been hard at work on a new business idea which I&#8217;ll be unveiling here over the next few weeks to you on this blog as I track the launch, new features, marketing efforts, and of course the results.</p>

<p>I am following my own philosophy that I teach: when you come across a new business idea, find the cheapest and fastest way to test it and just get SOMETHING out there which people can see and give you feedback on.  This is far better than what most people do which is either (1) have a great idea and think about it so long you never take any action on it or (2) spend way too much time and money on something that eventually turns out to not work.  If this doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;m going to find out quickly and have lost very little other than my time.</p>

<p>Total investment to launch this business:
$102.00 - 12 months of web hosting
$8.88 - one domain name
About 80 hours of my time.</p>

<p><strong>The Idea</strong>
As many of you know I&#8217;ve owned a tutoring business for 4 years now.  The way it works currently is that people fill out the form on my website requesting a tutor, then someone like myself or someone who works for me calls them back and sets them up with a tutor.  Typically, 3-4 phone calls and emails are involved with each new person who signs up from the time they first sign up to the time they are matched with a tutor and earning money.</p>

<p>One of the harder parts about growing the business is finding good people to match students with tutors.  People who will approach it with as much enthusiasm as I do (hard to find, since to them it is a job and to me its my own business).  And I can&#8217;t just do it all on my own, because that is being &#8220;self-employed&#8221;, not a true &#8220;business owner&#8221; who can <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-disappear-from-your-job-for-a-year-and-continue-to-earn-money/">disappear and the company continues to grow</a>.</p>

<p>So anyway, a friend of mine came up with the idea.  Yes you read that right, I didn&#8217;t even come up with this idea myself, remember that one of the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/10-ways-to-come-up-with-a-million-dollar-business-idea/">keys to coming up with great business ideas</a> is just to be around other people who have good ideas.  (In case you&#8217;re wondering, we structured an agreement so that he&#8217;ll be compensated if it works.)</p>

<p>The idea is to let people browse tutor profiles on the website and pick their own tutors.  All the tutors are college students at prestigious universities.  Clients can view lots of information to help them make a decision (the tutor&#8217;s major, GPA, feedback and reviews from other clients, picture, resume, location, etc).</p>

<p>Instead of taking a percentage of each hour of tutoring, which is what I do now, this would be more hands off approach and we&#8217;d only charge a flat fee to contact tutors since they&#8217;d be doing much of it on their own.</p>

<p>The beauty of this idea is that is scales well (something I talk about in <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">Breaking Free</a> extensively).  In other words, the amount of time required on my part to match 10 tutors vs. 10,000 tutors with this model is practically the same because the whole thing is automated through the website.  So even though I&#8217;d make less per hour of tutoring, it could reach a much wider audience.</p>

<p><strong>Sketching Out Ideas</strong></p>

<p>So I couldn&#8217;t sleep one night and decided to sketch out how this website might look.  I prefer to design on paper.  Designing a website in Photoshop or by coding it as I go seems to provide too much friction in the creative process.Â   Here are some early sketches.  You can see how things progressed and changed a little bit along the way.</p>

<p>Also, my theory on make good webpages (especially when in the product launch phase here when you just want to get something done quickly and &#8220;good enough&#8221;) is to find a design you like on another page, and tailor it to your own needs.  Don&#8217;t copy it outright, but pretty close is fine.  No need to reinvent the wheel early on.  Can you tell which site I borrowed liberally from? :)

<p><strong>Auto Completion</strong></p>

<p>One pretty neat feature I&#8217;ve already put in is auto completion.  Basically, when you start to type a class subject it guesses what you might want to put there and helps you out by making suggestions below.  You can see an example of what I&#8217;m talking about in the pictures.  This helps people make better search queries and helps them get the spelling right so they don&#8217;t get frustrated and leave.</p>

<p>By the way I&#8217;m using a relatively new programming language called <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> to develop this site, which makes doing things like this auto completion pretty easy.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/autocompletion1.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/autocompletion1.gif" alt="Auto Completion" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Coming Up Next&#8230;</strong>
Over the next few weeks I&#8217;ll be showing new features that come out and show you how I&#8217;m going to test out this idea and see if it works.</p>

<p>Site site is now live, you can visit it at: <a href="http://www.UniversityTutor.com">www.UniversityTutor.com</a></p>

<p>Stay tuned!

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/istock_000004878226xsmall1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/istock_000004878226xsmall1-150x150.jpg" alt="Creating Financial Statements" /></a>A lot of people shy away from any talk about &#8220;finance&#8221; or &#8220;accounting&#8221; because (1) its boring (2) it involves math and (3) its hard work.</p>

<p>Well it&#8217;s not as bad as you think.  I&#8217;m going to show you how to understand financial statements in about 5 minutes.  Then I&#8217;m going to give you some Excel templates to create your own. (See the video demo at the end.)</p>

<p>But first&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Why Should You Create A Personal Financial Statement?</strong></p>

<p>If you wanted to lose weight, you&#8217;d have to weigh yourself right?  If you wanted to be a great race car driver, you&#8217;d have to time your laps.</p>

<p>Well if you want to get rich (or become financially free), you have to create financial statements.</p>

<p>You are a business.  You have money come in and you have money going out.  You have things that you own and things that you owe.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have a way to MEASURE progress and COMPARE what works and what doesn&#8217;t, then you are just wandering blindly in the dark.</p>

<p>Robert Kiyosaki talks a lot about this, how rich people are &#8220;financially literate&#8221; and how this should be taught in schools.  That way we wouldn&#8217;t have so many Americans in credit card debt, losing their homes, and retiring flat broke only to become a burden on their families.</p>

<p>But that is another story.  The thing to remember is that something MAGICAL happens when you start to measure your progress.  Your success rate goes through the roof.</p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t looking at your financials about once a month then you quite simply AREN&#8217;T serious about becoming rich.  (You can pay a bookkeeper or accountant to do it as well if you don&#8217;t want to go through the process below.)</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Financial Statements In 5 Minutes</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tutored about a dozen people in MBA level finance and accounting courses.  Here is the explanation that seems to work the best.</p>

<p>There are only two types of financial statements that you really need to know: a balance sheet and an income statement.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/balance_sheet11.gif"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/balance_sheet11-150x150.gif" alt="Example Balance Sheet" /></a>
BALANCE SHEET</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shows what you own (assets) and what you owe (liabilities)</p></li>
<li><p>The difference between these two (assets - liabilities) is your net worth.</p></li>
<li><p>Shows one particular MOMENT in time, a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; if you will.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Click the thumbnail to the right to see an example.  As you can see, the money in your bank account, the market value of any property you own, your car (if you own it outright), and stocks are all examples of assets.  Mortgages, car payments, credit card debt, and other loans are all liabilities.  The difference is your net worth.  Notice how it says a specific day in January and not just &#8220;January 2008&#8221; because a balance sheet refers to one moment in time, not a period of time like a month.</p>

<p>February and March haven&#8217;t been filled out yet, but if you spent a few minutes once a month putting in those numbers you can see how easy it would be to track your progress month to month.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/income_statement1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/income_statement1-150x150.png" alt="Example Income Statement" /></a>
INCOME STATEMENT</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shows where money is coming in (income) and where money is going out (expenses)</p></li>
<li><p>The difference between these two (income - expenses) is your net income.</p></li>
<li><p>Shows what happened over a PERIOD of time, instead of how things are at one moment like a balance sheet.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Again, click the thumbnail to the right to see an example income statement.  For most people the primary source of income is their job so you might have that first.  After that you can see the income from those two properties listed on the balance sheet, as well as income from a small business you started, just as an example.  Secondly, you see expenses broken down by category and net income at the end.  I&#8217;ll show you how to quickly categorize your expenses in a minute.</p>

<p>Notice how in the second month your cash flow is negative and the number appears red.  Negative cash flow is bad!  It means you are spending more than you&#8217;re earning, and that is the way toward bankruptcy, not financial freedom.  If you hadn&#8217;t made your financial statement that month would you have ever know this?  Probably not.</p>

<p>Thats it.  Not as scary as you thought right?  On corporate financial statements you will sometimes see some strange terminology, but the basic concept is the same as for this personal financial statement.  Balance sheet: what you own, what you owe.  Income statement: what you made, what you spent.</p>

<p><strong>Why Quicken and Microsoft Money Suck</strong></p>

<p>Let me take a minute here and rant about how bad these two pieces of software are (in case you don&#8217;t know, they are the two most popular &#8220;personal finance&#8221; programs out there).  I think part of the reason so many people are afraid of getting their financial statements together is that at some point in time they booted up one of these two programs, spent several hours or days fiddling with things, and eventually got so frustrated that they never took another look at it.  At the very least the &#8220;pain&#8221; of using these programs causes people to subconsciously avoid doing their financial statements each month, and they rarely get done.</p>

<p>To me this is such a shame.  I could literally write an entire book on each one of these programs listing all the flaws in their design.  They should be used as case studies in every user interface design class in the country on how NOT to design software.  People tend to make excuses for them, saying that finance is complicated, or blaming themselves.  Nope, its just embarrassingly poor software design, end of story.</p>

<p>Is it any coincidence that an entire industry has been born of &#8220;Quicken Certified Professionals&#8221; who are basically consultants that went through enough classes to learn to use the program?</p>

<p>I mean, imagine if Google had designed a personal finance program.  The first time I used GMail I didn&#8217;t have to attend a class or hire a certified consultant to figure out how to use it.  It just worked.</p>

<p><strong>No Need For Reconciliation</strong></p>

<p>So ANYWAY (rant over)&#8230;how do we get around it?  Well, Quicken and MS Money are centered around this idea of <em>reconciliation</em>, which basically means you list all the things you spent money on and earned money from and then try to match each one to a line in your bank statement.  To me this is incredibly tedious, and you always find yourself in a situation where you are saying &#8220;ok I know that line on my bank statement is valid, but I don&#8217;t know how to account for it in this damn program, so its saying all my numbers are wrong&#8221;.  Then you give up.</p>

<p>To me, reconciliation is the worst part of the whole process, and the whole point of it is to make sure that no mistakes have been made (either by the bank, or on your part).  Well, I have a much easier solution to that problem:  JUST SCAN YOUR BANK STATEMENT AND SEE IF ANYTHING LOOKS OUT OF PLACE.</p>

<p>I can do that in about 30 seconds.  Sure its not as robust, and it would never work in a huge publicly traded company, but for me it works just great.  I don&#8217;t need to enter my $6.50 burrito and then match it to a line on my bank statement.  I know its supposed to be there so I just move on.</p>

<p>After all, I&#8217;m not really that concerned about the bank making mistakes or people illegally charging my card.  It rarely happens, and when it does its really easy to call and tell them it was a mistake and boom the money is back in your account.  They are really good about that these days.  So why spend 90% of your time (on reconciliation) worrying about a rare problem that is easily fixable?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m far more concerned about these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Did I make enough income to cover my expenses this month?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I continuing to grow my passive income (like from real estate), instead of relying on earned income (from a job)?</p></li>
<li><p>What am I spending money on and should I try to reduce/increase any of those areas?</p></li>
<li><p>Is my net worth increasing?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I taking on good debt (such as loans to buy houses that pay me each month) as opposed to bad debt (car payment, boats, vacation homes, etc which cost me money each month)?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Instead of using Quicken or MS Money, we going to use a program you probably already own to answer these questions: good old Excel.</p>

<p><strong>How To Use Excel To Create Your Financial Statements</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve created a video below to show you how to create your financial statements in just a few minutes.</p>

<p>Here are the basic steps:</p>

<p>Note that for many of these steps I say &#8220;log on to such and such website&#8221; to get a statement.  You can use paper statements that you get in the mail to do this, but I like to use online banking because the information is more up to date and you are guaranteed to have it all in one place instead of waiting for statements to arrive.  But do it however is most convenient to you.</p>

<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open your balance sheet template in Excel and log on to your bank website</p></li>
<li><p>Take the account totals for each of your bank accounts and put them in the template</p></li>
<li><p>If you own any real estate, log in to your mortgage website and see what your principal is at now.  It should go down a little bit each month, reducing your liability.</p></li>
<li><p>(Only need to do this step every 3 months or so, otherwise just copy the figure from the previous month over.)  Ask your real estate agent to get the current market value of any real estate you own.  This will update in the asset column.  It is an estimate, you won&#8217;t know for sure until you go to sell it, which is why we don&#8217;t update it every month.</p></li>
<li><p>Log in to your brokerage account if you own any stocks or bonds.  Update the current value of your stocks in the asset column.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the outstanding balances on any credit cards, student loans, car loans, etc that you still owe money on and update them in the liability column.  Hopefully these should go down each month.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Moving on to the INCOME STATEMENT</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open up your Income Sheet template in excel and log back in to your bank&#8217;s website.</p></li>
<li><p>Download the transactions for the previous month as a CSV file (this will open in a separate Excel file)</p></li>
<li><p>(See video for further details.)  Categorize each item on the bank statement and find the totals using Data->filter->autofilter and AutoSum.</p></li>
<li><p>Input each category of expense and income to your income statement.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Download The Excel Templates</strong></p>

<p>By the way I did not make these excel templates.  I have modified them, but the original templates came from the excellent <a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/2006/07/10/excel-template-for-net-worth-report-balance-sheet/">Consumerism Commentary blog</a>.  They deserve all the credit.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/balance-sheet-template1.xls">>>>Download the Excel Balance Sheet Template&lt;&lt;&lt;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/02/income-statement-template1.xls">>>>Download the Excel Income Statement Template&lt;&lt;&lt;</a></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Remember that financial statements are not scary, they are easy.</p>

<p>A balance sheet is just a list of what you own and what you owe at a particular moment in time.  Subtract one from the other and you see your net worth.  Make it grow!</p>

<p>An income statement is nothing more than a list of what money you earned and what money you spent over a period of time.  Subtract one from the other and you see your net income.  Make it grow!</p>

<p>And of course, as a bigger picture goal, you should be trying to get more and more <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-disappear-from-your-job-for-a-year-and-continue-to-earn-money/">assets that GENERATE INCOME (like real estate) and start businesses</a> so that you eventually won&#8217;t have to have a job to cover your expenses each month.  In other words, you should be &#8220;breaking free&#8221;.</p>

<p>I hope you&#8217;ve seen the importance of financial statements now.  Only whats measured gets done, and if you aren&#8217;t measuring your financial health each month, then the chances of you blindly stumbling upon wealth one day are not high.</p>

<p>Best of luck, and if you have any questions or comments please leave them in the comment box below.</p>

<p>Thank you,
Brian Armstrong</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/01/tatoo1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/01/tatoo1-150x150.png" alt="Tattoo Viral Marketing" /></a>Just wanted to alert you to this brilliant piece of viral marketing: <a href="http://www.carmenhasacrushonyou.com/">Carmen Has A Crush On You</a>.</p>

<p>Without ruining the surprise too much, it asks you to put the name, phone number, and picture of a friend of yours into a simple webpage with the lure of playing a joke on your friend.</p>

<p>It then uses a clever bit of technology to instantly create a youtube video where Carmen Electra spills the beans on her new relationship with your friend, including his name tattooed on her, a picture of him that she keeps in her wallet, and a follow up phone call.</p>

<p>The reason this is going to be so effective is several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The technology is new enough that is still has the shock value.  Most people have never seen anything like it and will wonder how its possible.</p></li>
<li><p>By including someone you know in the video, it is much more likely to be forwarded to your circle of friends.  The joke is personalized for everyone.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You notice that the one thing she couldn&#8217;t do on the film was actually say the person&#8217;s name.  The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtYLxL-B--U">technology for text-to-speech</a> is getting much better but isn&#8217;t quite there yet.  They seemed to get around it though.</p>

<p>Kudos to whoever made this.  It is one of the most innovative viral marketing pieces I&#8217;ve seen in a long time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYou-Can-Choose-Be-Rich%2Fdp%2FB000CSXWXW%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1200610701%26sr%3D8-2&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/01/c2c262e89da059bbfd7b4110_aa240_l1-150x150.jpg" alt="Robert Kiyosaki - Choose to be rich" /></a>I&#8217;ve been listening lately to Robert Kiyosaki&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYou-Can-Choose-Be-Rich%2Fdp%2FB000CSXWXW%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1200610701%26sr%3D8-2&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Choose To Be Rich</a>, and I have to say that it is outstanding.</p>

<p>Probably one of the top three book on building wealth I&#8217;ve come across, and as you know I&#8217;ve read (or listened to) a lot.</p>

<p>He gets into all sorts of topics in the book, but here are three ideas that stood out in my mind.</p>

<p>Hopefully you will find them as insightful as I did.  They may even challenge some closely held ideas that you have!</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Having Lots Of Money Doesn&#8217;t Make You Rich</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Being rich is much more about your mindset and your financial intelligence than it is about how much money you have.</p>

<p>Take Richard Branson for example.  The man is a billionaire, but if you took all that money away from him he would still have all the knowledge.  He would still know how to start businesses, invest wisely, etc.  In fact, if he had to start from zero today I&#8217;m quite sure Richard Branson would have lots of money again in less than five years.</p>

<p>Take the opposite example though: what about a person who wins the lottery but doesn&#8217;t understand how to be rich?  Is it any wonder that 1 in 3 lottery winners are flat broke in five years?  Even though they had all the money in the world, they still had the mindset and financial intelligence of a poor person, so they lost their money. They were not &#8220;rich&#8221;.</p>

<p>If you understand how to build wealth than you are rich, no matter how much money you have.</p>

<p>A person who make $100,000 a year and spends $100,000 a year is not rich.  They are thinking like a poor person and remaining stuck in the rat race.  In fact, a person who makes $40,000 a year and invests $20,000 is richer.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The Longer You Can Go Without Working, The Wealthier You Are</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>As alluded to in point #1, rich people save and invest a portion of their money.  What do they invest in?  Passive income streams that pay them whether they work or not.</p>

<p>If you have no savings, then it doesn&#8217;t matter how much money you make per year; you aren&#8217;t wealthy.  If you stopped working today, how long could you continue to pay for your current lifestyle?  A month?  Six months?  A year?</p>

<p>The longer you could go, the wealthier you are.  And the wealthiest people are those that are financially free.  That means their passive income streams are enough to cover their expenses.  Effectively, they could go on forever at their current level of living without working again.  Thats why I <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-single-most-important-thing-to-do-in-2008/">set a goal</a> this year to get to at least $2,000 per month in passive income buying real estate.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Rich And Poor People Focus On Different Types Of Income</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>According to Kiyosaki, there are three types of income:  (1) earned income from a job, (2) portfolio income from stocks or bonds, and (3) passive income from real estate or other income generating assets.</p>

<p>Poor and middle class people focus on earned income.  There are two problems with this.</p>

<p>First, you only get paid when you work.  And there are a fixed amount of hours in the day, which means there is a cap on how much money you can make via earned income.  The second problem with earned income is what Robert Kiyosaki calls &#8220;50% money&#8221;.  Essentially the government takes 50% of every earned income dollar you make.  Money is taken out of your paycheck before you ever get it, and then more money is taken out when you pay taxes.</p>

<p>Poor and middle class people focus on earned income, and try to get rich by working twice as hard.</p>

<p>Rich people on the other hand focus on the other two types of income, portfolio income and passive income.  These are not dependent on the number of hours in a day, so they grow indefinitely, and they are far better in terms of taxes too.  The highest capital gains tax rate is 15% and in real estate you can often pay zero taxes or defer the taxes forever.</p>

<p>If you get a chance, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYou-Can-Choose-Be-Rich%2Fdp%2FB000CSXWXW%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1200610701%26sr%3D8-2&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">check out Choose To Be Rich</a>.  I think you&#8217;ll really enjoy it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever seen someone complain about a parking ticket as if it&#8217;s the end of the world?</p>

<p>Have you been cut off in traffic and let it ruin your whole day?</p>

<p>How many times have you let your experience at the airport (crying baby, delayed flight, missing luggage) be the first thing you bring up in conversations with friends?</p>

<p>I want you to repeat after me: &#8220;these things happen&#8221;.</p>

<p>We all have these types of events come up in life, but successful people just go on as if nothing has happened, and unsuccessful people let it derail them.</p>

<p>The next time you feel a surge of anger coming on over an insignificant event in your life, go over these points in your head:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You look like an idiot</strong>
There is no polite way to put this.  When others around you see you COMPLETELY lose it over the dent in your car door, they aren&#8217;t feeling sorry for you and wondering how they can help.  They are subconsciously judging you and coming to one inescapable conclusion: you aren&#8217;t in control of your life.</li>
</ol>


<p>If something this small throws you off, imagine how you&#8217;d react to a REAL problem in life.  Overreacting tells the people around you that you can&#8217;t be trusted to deal with important issues.  You&#8217;re not the goto guy (or gal) when they&#8217;re in need, because you can&#8217;t even take care of yourself.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The only person you&#8217;re hurting is yourself</strong>
Did you ever realize that when you get upset at someone who cuts you off in traffic, they generally never even know?  Usually they speed off never the wiser to your insults and gestures.  By getting angry, you&#8217;re doing zero harm to them while simultaneously hurting yourself even more.  That doesn&#8217;t make much sense, and is a waste of your precious time and energy.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now heres the zinger.  What if that person purposely WANTED to upset you (they have some subconscious need to pick on others, they&#8217;re parents didn&#8217;t love them enough, etc)?  Well then they are getting the exact reaction they wanted, and you&#8217;re playing right into they hands.</p>

<p>If you really want to mess with someone who flips you off in traffic, try smiling and waving back, and watch the confused look on their face.  With time, you can even learn to appreciate and love these people (bizarre I know) for the important role they serve in life: helping to remind you how NOT to live.  Don&#8217;t judge them, they are just at a different point in understanding life.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Find something to be grateful about</strong>
So you&#8217;re sitting there in rush hour traffic about ready to tear your hair out.  Train yourself to go right into gratitude, and start listing what you&#8217;re grateful for and what good can come from this situation.</li>
</ol>


<p>Maybe its the perfect time to make a phone call to a loved one you&#8217;ve been putting off.  Maybe you can get some &#8220;reading&#8221; done on that <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">audio book</a> you&#8217;re listening to and be grateful for the chance to learn something new.  Maybe its just a chance to put things in perspective and marvel at how far technology has come.  After all, primitive mankind would have had to walk this distance.  You get to SIT in an air conditioned chair barely pushing the accelerator.</p>

<p>There is something good in every situation, and you can find it.  Even if its just that you&#8217;re grateful for the chance to practice being grateful.</p>

<p><em>Unsuccessful people</em> are REACTIVE.  They are a leaf blowing in the wind, the world is happening around them, and they are just trying to stay alive.  When something bad happens, someone did it TO them and they take it personally.  They get caught up in the victim mentality and take every opportunity to let people know it.</p>

<p><em>Successful people</em>, on the other hand, are PROACTIVE.  They make things happen in life and are on a mission.  And by golly, they aren&#8217;t going to let some silly parking ticket take them off their mission.  Instead, they say to themselves &#8220;these things happen&#8221; and move on to more important tasks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/01/898293_deporte_meseta_patagonica_51.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/01/898293_deporte_meseta_patagonica_51-150x150.jpg" alt="Estimating Risk" /></a>The latest issue of Psychology Today has an interesting article on how human beings don&#8217;t estimate risk well.  Most people let fear (irrational fear, that is) run their life.  And it prevents them from  accomplishing great things, not the least of which is quitting your job to start your own business.</p>

<p>Psychology Today included this short test, which I found to be incredibly revealing.  See how many you can get right.  Answer are at the end, don&#8217;t peak.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What&#8217;s more common in the United States, (a) suicide or (b) homicide?</p></li>
<li><p>Whats the more frequent cause of death in the United States, (a) pool drowning or (b) falling out of bed?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the top five causes of accidental death in America, following motor-vehicle accidents?</p></li>
<li><p>Of the top two causes of non accidental death in America, (a) cancer and (b) heart disease, which kills more women?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the next three causes of non accidental death in the United States?</p></li>
<li><p>Which has killed more Americans, bird flu or mad cow disease?</p></li>
<li><p>How many Americans die from AIDS every year, (a) 12,995 (b) 728,200, or (c) 1,299,500?</p></li>
<li><p>How many Americans die from diabetes every year, (a) 72,820, (b) 728,200, or (c) 7,282,000?</p></li>
<li><p>Which kills more Americans, (a) appendicitis or (b) salmonella?</p></li>
<li><p>Which kills more Americans, (a) pregnancy and childbirth or (b) malnutrition?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>ANSWERS: 1. a. 2. a. 3. (in order) drug overdose, fire, choking, falling down stairs, bicycle accidents. 4. b. 5. (in order) stroke, respiratory disease, diabetes. 6. No American has died from either one. 7. a. 8. a. 9. a. 10. b.</p>

<p>How did you do?  Haha, number 6 was my favorite (admittedly, a trick question).</p>

<p>One final interesting quote from the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>After 9/11, 1.4 million people changed their holiday travel plans to avoid flying.  The vast majority chose to drive instead.  But driving is far more dangerous than flying, and the decision to switch caused roughly 1,000 additional auto fatalities, according to two separate analyses comparing traffic patterns in late 2001 to those the year before.  In other words, 1,000 people who chose to drive wouldn&#8217;t have died had they flown instead.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lets be rational about our fears in 2008, and don&#8217;t be afraid to take calculated risks based on good teaching/evidence.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A great post from <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/12/only-two-years.html">Seth Godin&#8217;s blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>While you&#8217;ve been wishing for the inspiration to start something great, thousands of entrepreneurs have used the prevailing sense of uncertainty to start truly remarkable companies. Lucrative Web businesses, successful tool catalogs, fast-growing PR firms &#8211; all have started on a shoestring, and all have been profitable ahead of schedule. The Web is dead, right? Well, try telling that to Meetup.com, a new Web site that helps organize meetings anywhere and on any topic. It has 200,000 registered users &#8211; and counting.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like goals, and especially new years resolutions.</p>

<p>I went back and reviewed some of my 2007 new years resolutions.  Some I had accomplished (buying my first investment property and making it cash flow) and some are still in progress (sale of a business).  But in all honesty, the majority of them I had not accomplished, primarily because they are no longer goals.  I guess my goals change often.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I think its awfully worthwhile to write your goals down (and far more often than once a year!).  Here are a few tips on your 2008 resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Write them down</strong>
Goals in your head are no more than ideas.  Writing them forces you to get all the details.  (Yes, typing counts)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make them measurable</strong>
Saying &#8220;I want to earn more&#8221; isn&#8217;t measurable.  You can never know if you actually achieved it or not.  Saying &#8220;I want to earn $76,500 in the year 2008&#8221; is measurable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget the how</strong>
Careful what you wish for.  Saying &#8220;I want to weight 146 lbs&#8221; doesn&#8217;t specify how.  There are some unhealthy ways to accomplish that, and you want to be specific.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep it positive</strong>
Focus on what you want, not what you don&#8217;t want.  Instead of saying &#8220;I stop hating my boss&#8221;, try &#8220;I get a raise and promotion&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use the present tense</strong>
Saying &#8220;I&#8217;m going to&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I will try&#8230;&#8221; is weak.  Write the goal as if it has already taken place.  &#8220;I date Heidi Klum.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make them ambitious yet possible</strong>
Force yourself to reach, but if you make them too ambitious you&#8217;ll be disappointed.  There should probably about a 50/50 chance of accomplishing it in your own mind.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make them public</strong>
I don&#8217;t always recommend telling your goals to people who won&#8217;t be supportive, but making them public in a supportive place will help you stay on track.  We&#8217;re more likely to follow through with peer pressure, which is why&#8230;</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>You have the opportunity to write your #1 goal to accomplish in 2008 below.  Please leave a comment (sticking as best you can to the guidelines above, doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect).  If you leave your email, I promise I&#8217;ll check up on you before the end of 2008 to see how things are going!</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/51">great 20 minute talk</a> on weaning the US off oil.  Particularly intriguing is the idea that this could actually be hugely profitable (not government mandated).  Entrepreneurs in this sector will make a killing off of energy innovations in the next ten to twenty years.</p>
