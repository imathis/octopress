  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yaro Starak has got a couple more great pieces of content up.</p>

<p>First, of all you can check out <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/caradvice">this interview he did with Alborz Fallah</a>.</p>

<p>Alborz started <a href="http://www.caradvice.com.au/">a blog</a> about cars that is targetted to the Australian market.  It now makes over a half million per year in revenue and is valued at $5 Million.  And he started the blog while working at his full time job!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/caradvice"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/07/alborz11.jpg" alt="Aston Martin" /></a></p>

<p>He also put up two more videos that show exactly how he (Yaro) makes money on his blog.  There is a breakdown from a whole bunch of different sources, many of which I use on this blog as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/how"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/07/how-i-make-money1.gif" alt="How I Make Money Online" /></a></p>

<p>He also includes a behind the scenes look at his tracking software where you can see the proof (checks, orders coming in, etc) or how he actually makes over $10k per month on his blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/how"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/07/show-me-the-money1.gif" alt="Show me the money" /></a></p>

<p>This is great educational material, and very inspiring.  Thanks Yaro.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been watching <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/yaro">Yaro Starak&#8217;s</a> stuff for a while, and he has had some great success over the last year or two.  I&#8217;ve seen his blog go from just a few thousand subscribers to now over 30,000, and he has a very similar niche to this site: entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s cool is that Yaro now consistently makes over $10,000 per month from his blog.  And he does it working less than 2 hours per day.  He has &#8220;broken free&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/yaro"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/07/yaro1.jpg" alt="Yaro Starak" /></a></p>

<p>Blogging is a pretty cool business model.  It&#8217;s certainly not easy though.  And it can take several years to really get a blog to the point where it&#8217;s making money.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, I think the key is to <strong>pick a topic that you would write about whether anyone is reading your blog or not</strong>.  Essentially, use your blog like a private journal where you would write your own thoughts and ideas for your own benefit.</p>

<p>Because when you first start out it REALLY WILL be for only your own benefit since you will likely have very few readers.</p>

<p>The people who fail at blogging are people who write about something they don&#8217;t really care about.  They will try it for a month or two and then give up before it really starts to pay off.</p>

<p>That being said, Yaro has released some really cool videos lately that show some of the tricks he has used to become a successful blogger.  The videos are free and I suggest you check them out.  I&#8217;m learning a lot from them.</p>

<p>Check them out here:
<a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/yaro"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/07/conversion-blogging11.jpg" alt="Conversion Blogging" /></a></p>

<p>He has a &#8220;Blog Mastermind&#8221; program too where he teaches people how to have more success as a blogger.  If you are interested in that, it&#8217;s good investment.   You can <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/blog_mastermind">read more about it here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To date, the most popular post on this blog has been <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-stop-letting-little-things-in-life-piss-you-off/">How To Stop Letting Little Things In Life Piss You Off</a>, which is interesting because&#8230;well, it has nothing to do with how to start a business ;)</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s ok.  Today I thought I&#8217;d share a similar tip.  It is utterly simple, I use it often, and it really works.</p>

<p>We all feel sad at times.  It can even happen for no apparent reason at all!  One day you might just be driving along and wonder to yourself, &#8220;why am I feeling so down, this is weird and there is no reason I should feel this way&#8221;.  Or you may have a legitimate reason.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&#8217;ve discovered a little trick that is counterintuitive and can make you feel better right away: <strong>give someone a genuine compliment totally out of the blue</strong>.</p>

<p>I think this works because it takes the focus off of you.  It makes you realize that if you are sitting there feeling sorry for yourself, then it probably happens to other people too.  So why not start thinking about someone else for a change and help them out!  Ironically, you do end up helping yourself out in the process&#8230;it just happens indirectly by thinking about other people instead.</p>

<p>About a month ago I went running with two friends.  Usually I feel &#8220;high&#8221; after running.  Supposedly it releases endorphins or something like that.  But that day for some reason I didn&#8217;t.  On the drive home, I decided to stop thinking about myself and try it out since I knew it had worked in the past.</p>

<p>Now if you&#8217;re like me, it can feel a little weird giving someone a huge compliment out of the blue.  So I cheated and sent a text message.  To one of my female friends I had just ran with I sent &#8220;nice job today you are getting faster, keep it up!&#8221;  She is always the slow one in the group and I knew that would make her feel better.</p>

<p>When my buddy Marshal finally landed a meeting with some potential buyers for his company, I sent him a quick note &#8220;Hey super star, all the hard work has finally paid off&#8230;you deserve it!&#8221;.  He walked in more confident.</p>

<p>After a party one time I sent a message to a friend the next day: &#8220;by the way, I meant to tell you last night you looked incredibly classy&#8230; seriously you were radiating, not sure what it was but keep it up!&#8221;  She pretty much melted.</p>

<p>Try it out next time you&#8217;re feeling sad.  Give someone a compliment that is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Genuine</p></li>
<li><p>Huge</p></li>
<li><p>and Out of the Blue</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Till next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend of mine, Mark Bent, is giving away <a href="http://www.sunnightsolar.com/blog/?p=7">500 of his solar flashlights</a> to people who are traveling or who are in positions to help his idea spread.</p>

<p>If you plan on traveling in the near future of you can help spread this idea, <a href="mailto:info@sunnightsolar.com">send him your story</a> and he&#8217;ll send you an awesome solar flashlight absolutely free.</p>

<p>This is actually one of the most interesting business ideas I&#8217;ve seen recently, and I spent a summer working with Mark on this project as a volunteer.</p>

<p>The flashlight is the best and only one that I own (I have one of the older models, see picture below).  It is light weight, durable, and best of all&#8230;always charged!  I just leave it in the windowsill.  It can go 6 hours on a single days charge just from sunlight (which is leaps and bounds ahead of any other &#8220;rechargeable&#8221; flashlight I&#8217;ve seen like those ones with the crank on it that provides light for about 30 seonds, literally).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sunnightsolar.com/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/07/solar-flashlights1.png" alt="SunNightSolar Solar Flashlight" /></a></p>

<p><strong>But this idea is actually much bigger than just making a better flashlight.  Here&#8217;s why:</strong></p>

<p>Most people don&#8217;t realize that in the developing world, 2 Billion people (1/3 of the planet) don&#8217;t have access to clean, affordable light.  In Ethiopia for example, something like 3% of the population is connected to the electric grid.  What people use for light is primarily kerosene lanterns (which is costly, a fire hazard, and causes smoke inhalation problems) and battery powered flashlights (which are, again, expensive, and also pollute when batteries are discarded).</p>

<p>What this means is that is that if you work all day, then when the sun goes down things are very different.  If you&#8217;re a child, you can&#8217;t do homework.  There are literally children in the world who try to do homework under a streetlight and hope it stays on for a least a half hour each night.  If you&#8217;re a woman, you may not feel (or be) safe at night.  No matter who you are in the developing world, the cost of kerosene or batteries for light can be a substantial part of your income just to get an hour or two of light in the evening.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really hard to overstate the impact that clean, affordable light could have on the developing world.  Here are a few issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Education</strong>:  This is the biggest one in my mind.  Many children have to work during the day in farming or crafts for their family.  Even if they go to school, without light at night they can never learn to read, do math, etc which will have the biggest long term effect on a country.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Environment</strong>: Kerosene lanterns contribute green house gases and disposed batteries are toxic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health</strong>: Smoke inhalation and fire are both health concerns in the developing world.  In addition, without light the lack of activities at night and rape both contribute to the spread of aids.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economy</strong>: The cost of kerosene or batteries to someone who subsists on just a few dollars be day is a large percentage of their income.  Once energy for light becomes free (from the sun), that money can now be diverted into starting a business, health care, etc.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/07/brians-solar-flashlight2.jpg" alt="Brian’s Solar Flashlight" /></p>

<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;ve got a cool story, <a href="http://www.sunnightsolar.com/blog/?p=7">send it to Mark</a>.</p>

<p>Or if you just want one for personal use, he has a &#8221;<a href="http://www.bogolight.com/">buy one give one</a>&#8221; program that is a really good deal.  For $25 he&#8217;ll send you one and also send one to the developing world, including shipping.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you noticed that lots of businesses are based around the idea of a &#8220;rating system&#8221;?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Can we lend money to this person?  Check their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score">credit score</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it a good movie?  Check it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> number.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it a popular web page?  Check it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">page rank</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The essence of the idea is to take something with a lot of complex factors and simplify it into one number.</p>

<p>This makes people&#8217;s lives easier because now they can quickly compare two items and see which is better.</p>

<p>Imagine all the factors that go into deciding whether someone is a credit risk.  You have to look at their income, rental history, current debts, tax returns, etc.  If you had a list of 100 people to evaluate it would take forever to pull that all up and compare each person.  But with a credit score the task is now easy.  Pay a small fee to pull up the credit score on each person and sort them from highest to lowest!</p>

<p>Clearly there is value in this since it saves people time and lets them make quick decisions.</p>

<p>What other products don&#8217;t have a standard ranking or score associated with it yet?  Maybe you can be the first brand to become the standard for that industry.  Not just a website with a rating system on it, but THE standard.  The FICO score of cell phones, if you will.  The kind where your brand becomes a part of every day language.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got that new [some product]?  Cool, I heard it got a 92 Brian score.&#8221;</p>

<p>Basically you would help people answer a very fundamental question: &#8220;Is this good?&#8221;</p>

<p>One other interesting thing to note here is that the &#8220;scales&#8221; of each of these varies.  Credit scores go from about 400 to 850 (which I always thought was ridiculous) while Rotten Tomatoes goes from 1 to 100 and Page rank from 1 to 10.  Of course, mathematically you can convert any scale into any other scale so it is totally arbitrary which one you pick.</p>

<p>Of these I think I like the 1 to 10 the best.  It&#8217;s the simplest and conveys the most information quickly.  After all, is a movie with a 74 rating really better than a 72?  Based on a limited number of votes they really are about the same.  Using a 1 to 100 scale almost implies it&#8217;s more accurate than it really is.  I think 1 to 10 conveys just the right amount of information (whereas some systems, like the traditional &#8220;4 star&#8221; movie rating system doesn&#8217;t convey enough).</p>

<p>I think it could work with any product that is sufficiently complicated to buy (or a matter of opinion like movies).  Cars, real estate, electronics, bands&#8230;who knows.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think this could work?  Post an idea in the comments below.  Or keep it for yourself and go out there to make it!</strong></p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I&#8217;m going to coin a term: the debug cycle.</p>

<p>Whenever trying to solve a problem or accomplish something, we typically go through a cycle.</p>

<ol>
<li>Try something</li>
<li>See if it works</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>


<p>This is a cycle, and the faster we can go through it the better.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example.  Imagine for a minute that you were creating a website.  Even if you know nothing about programming, it will still make sense.</p>

<p>What most coders do is get into a rhythm.  (1) Make a little change in the code, (2) hit the save button, (3) reload the webpage to see how it looks.  Then go back and do it again.</p>

<p>The debug cycle starts to happen REALLY fast.  For example, many programmers start to use keyboard shortcuts.  Apple-S saves it, Apple-tab switches to the other screen, and Apple-R reloads the page.  (Or ctrl-s, alt-tab, ctrl-r if you&#8217;re on PC).  This all happens in less than a second.</p>

<p>Here is a little <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWHuod54Oo">video to illustrate</a>.</p>

<p>See, nice and fast.  It&#8217;s easy to <strong>test if what you&#8217;re doing is working</strong>.</p>

<p>Thats the key.  When the cycle is fast, you are productive.</p>

<p>But now imagine that something slowed down your debug cycle.</p>

<p>Lets say, each time you wanted to test a change you had to upload the file to some server, restart a database, fill out a form, and then see the result.  Suddenly your productivity plummets.</p>

<p>Even a small increase, of say 10 seconds, to each debug cycle is a big problem, because you repeat the cycle so many times that it adds up quickly.</p>

<p>The important thing to realize is that&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>This idea applies to every problem you are ever going to solve</strong></p>

<p>Did you ever wonder why they like to use mice in medical experiments?  Well aside from the fact they are cheap and and people have fewer moral problems with it compared to, say, a kitten&#8230;.mice reproduce quickly.</p>

<p>That means your debug cycle is shorter.  You can try some gene modification on 100 different mice and in 4 weeks see how they grow up.</p>

<p>Why is it easier to write a good ad in Google Adwords than in the Newspaper?  Adwords has a shorter debug cycle.  You can see how an ad performed in just a few hours instead of a few weeks.</p>

<p>Why do windtunnels work?  Because they shorten the debug cycle.  You can build 10 different model airplanes in a week (that don&#8217;t even fly) and test them in there to see how they work before investing in a real full-size one.</p>

<p>Why is it hard to cure male pattern baldness?  Because for any treatment you come up with it takes at least a year for a follicle to grow and see if it works.</p>

<p>Why is it hard to lose weight?  Long debug cycle.  You could try some new diet and not see any change for a month or two.  Hard to know if its really working.</p>

<p>Bottom line, it&#8217;s difficult to measure outcomes in a long debug cycle, and to solve any problem you will need to test a lot of different ideas.</p>

<p><strong>What about starting a business?</strong></p>

<p>For most people, starting a business is a long debug cycle.  You think about an idea for a few years,  pursue venture capital for 6 months, take on the debt, finally get some funding, put a 1 year lease on an office, recruit some new hires, get lost in endless meetings, work on a project, travel to conferences, finally release a project after 4 years, and then realize the market doesn&#8217;t want it so you scrap the whole thing.</p>

<p>ORRR&#8230;.</p>

<p>You could go from <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">new business idea to launch in 1 month for $100</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, in <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">Breaking Free</a> I have an exhaustive list of all the unnecessary stuff you can eliminate when starting a business so you can focus on what matters.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s the lesson?</strong></p>

<p>Invest up front in making a streamlined debug cycle.  It will pay off in spades down the road.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in medicine, simulate thousands of compounds on a computer instead of having to to make each one for real in a lab.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re an author, post a bunch of short essays on a blog to see what people want to read before writing the whole book.</p>

<p>If you want to break free, test a whole bunch of small business ideas with as little time and money as humanly possible until you find one that works.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free&#8230;

<blockquote><p>Why does the idea of work have to be so bad that you want to sacrifice year’s worth of prime living to get away from it forever? The answer is that it doesn’t. Finding something you to love to work on seems to be a much more fruitful pursuit than trying to get away from the notion of work altogether.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/about.shtml">Where the hell is Matt?  He broke free in a rather unconventional way&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>A couple years later, someone found the video online and passed it to someone else, who passed it to someone else, and so on. Now Matt is quasi-famous as &#8220;That guy who dances on the internet. No, not that guy. The other one. No, not him either. I&#8217;ll send you the link. It&#8217;s funny.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>According to Mark Cuban, &#8220;Do everything you can to avoid taking money.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Sweat equity is the best equity. Taking money from someone else kills more start-ups than anything else does. Do everything you can to avoid taking money. If you must, your best prospects are potential customers. You have something they want, so if they invest in you, it can be a win-win situation.&#8221;</p>
