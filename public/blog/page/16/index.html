  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you realize how many doors that simple phrase can open for you?</p>

<p>Everything - from meetings with important people to free press any time you launch a new project - is yours if you&#8217;re known for something that people love.</p>

<p>So how do you do it?  Start publishing your ideas.  You need distribution.</p>

<p>In Ben Franklin&#8217;s time, distribution was expensive.  Now all you need is a blog, a YouTube video, or a self published book to get started.  It&#8217;s free, what are you waiting for?</p>

<time datetime="2008-11-02T19:25:19-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 2<span>nd</span>, 2008</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok so <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-tell-whats-bullshit-and-whats-true-part-1/">in Part One</a> we talked about how people often form incorrect beliefs about the world due to anecdotal evidence, the correlation-causation mistake, and the logical fallacy &#8220;if you can&#8217;t prove it false, it must be true&#8221;.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;re going to talk about the correct way to decide if something is true: the scientific method.</p>

<p>The scientific method is an entire process with plenty of steps.  But I&#8217;m just going to show you 3 pieces of it which you may not know about or have forgotten since high school.</p>

<p><strong>The scientific method is AWESOME because it filters out bullshit.  No longer can someone make a claim without backing it up and going through the right steps.  In fact, that&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s so important to understand this: if you see someone skipping the steps they are most likely LYING to you.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Double Blind Experiments</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Human being&#8217;s have biases.  Even when you think you don&#8217;t have a bias, you might.  For example, you may have heard of the &#8220;placebo effect&#8221; where people who take sugar pills (which do nothing) say they feel better.  People who are given taste tests usually choose their regular brand, but when the brands are hidden they choose differently.  Even more shockingly, you might think you don&#8217;t have any race or gender biases but you can take <a href="http://www.understandingprejudice.org/iat/index2.htm">this test as many times as you like</a> and you probably do.</p>

<p>So this means proper experiments must have a &#8220;control&#8221;.  If you are going to give a pill to one group, then you should have another group of the same size that you give the placebo too.  They are the &#8220;control&#8221; group and only by comparing the results of the two can you isolate one variable to test without bias.</p>

<p>In a true double blind experiment, the person being tested doesn&#8217;t know which group they are in (the &#8220;real&#8221; one or the control) and neither does the researcher.</p>

<p>Double blinds experiments provide great evidence that Astrology is bullshit.  As you can probably guess, all you have to do is not tell the test subject which month or &#8220;sign&#8221; you&#8217;re reading from and ask them if it applies to them.  They end up saying yes or no just as often no matter what their sign is.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Peer Review</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Peer review means that if you want to claim something is true, you have to document the steps of your experiment and other scientists around the world have to be able to <em>duplicate your results</em>.</p>

<p>If other people can&#8217;t duplicate your results then you are probably full of shit.</p>

<p>For example, you&#8217;ve probably heard of people trying to run a car on water.  Water has hydrogen in it and hydrogen is a good fuel, so it would be great if we could get the hydrogen out of the water.  The problem is that it takes more energy to separate the oxygen from the hydrogen than you get out of the hydrogen so it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Yet this doesn&#8217;t stop some lunatic from coming out (probably every year) claiming they&#8217;ve invented a car that runs on water.  Even major news organizations get duped occasionally like when FOX News in Houston ran this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rb_rDkwGnU">video segment</a> giving one such lunatic a lot of press.  It turns out that the guy is using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyhydrogen">Oxyhydrogen torch</a> which has been around since 1977 (and still uses more energy than it produces in hydrogen).</p>

<p>From peer review of his patent application we now know him to be full of shit, and his &#8220;company&#8221; <a href="http://hytechapps.com/">Hydrogen Technology Applications</a> is a scam.  The FOX News reporters should have read this blog article so they understood peer review :)</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sample Size</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>This is also sometimes called &#8220;statistical significance&#8221; and basically means you need to run your tests enough times (or with enough people) to show the result didn&#8217;t happen from chance.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this also shows why anecdotal evidence is not evidence at all.  Your sample size isn&#8217;t large enough if &#8220;everyone I talked to&#8221; means five people.</p>

<p>For example, let&#8217;s say that you want to test how often a flipped coin comes up heads vs. tails (which we know to be 50/50).  Well if you did the test 1 time, that obviously wouldn&#8217;t be enough.  But what if you flipped the coin say 5 times.  Would that be enough?</p>

<p>Well it depends.  There is about a 3% chance you&#8217;d get 5 tails in a row, and a 3% chance you&#8217;d get 5 heads in a row (which is no where near the true answer) and a range of other possibilities.</p>

<p>Would 10 be enough?  20?  Without getting into the math, the main point to take away is that you must have a large enough sample size to be &#8220;confident&#8221; about your answer.  Any claim which isn&#8217;t based on statistically significant data is meaningless.</p>

<p><strong>So to review, what is wrong with this statement:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve developed an incredible new weight loss pill!  Of the 10 people I gave it to 10 of them lost weight and no one died.  Buy it now!!!</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m exaggerating a little of course :)  But this should raise your bullshit detectors because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There was no &#8220;control group&#8221; of people who DIDN&#8217;T take the pill (Double Blind)</p></li>
<li><p>The claim has not been verified by anyone else (Peer Review).</p></li>
<li><p>Testing 10 people is not enough to draw any meaningful conclusions. (Sample Size)</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>A Pigeon Video</strong></p>

<p>Finally, I&#8217;ll leave you with this interesting pigeon video as promised.  This is from Richard Dawkin&#8217;s excellent documentary called Enemies of Reason.</p>

<p>It shows an experiment done by B.F. Skinner which gives some shocking insight into human behavior.  If you can&#8217;t see the video below <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7218293233140975017#35m54s">click here</a>.  I suggest watching the whole thing if you have time, it&#8217;s excellent.</p>

<p><strong>The pigeon part is around the 36 minute mark.</strong></p>

<p>What do those pigeons remind you of?  Sports fans at a game who wear their &#8220;lucky&#8221; hat?  Something more serious like gambling?  And the scariest of all: perhaps a belief that you have?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>It bothers me that more people don&#8217;t understand these sorts of things.  In the dark ages we were primitive people running around naked, dirty, and ignorant - slaves to superstitions and scam artists making false claims.  Blood letting was common medical practice.  Then in the enlightenment we developed these brilliant tools (double blind experiments, peer review, and statistical significance are just 3 examples) that allowed us to do a very important thing: TELL BULLSHIT FROM THE TRUTH.</p>

<p>This lead to science which has allowed us to get a heart transplant, email people around the world, and travel to the moon.</p>

<p>But sometimes it feels like we&#8217;re heading back to the dark ages.  I heard someone remark one time that:</p>

<blockquote><p>The last time I went into a book store there were 10 books on astrology and 2 on astronomy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hopefully this article will help someone people make educated decisions about the truth.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been shocked lately to notice how many of my friends (who are otherwise very intelligent) believe things which are totally false.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just my friends.  A remarkably large percentage of the population (and <em>gasp</em> maybe even you) believe some things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can catch a cold from going outside with wet hair.</p></li>
<li><p>The position of the planets at your birth changes your personality (Astrology).</p></li>
<li><p>Shaving causes hair to grow back thicker/faster.</p></li>
<li><p>More babies are born on a full moon.</p></li>
<li><p>Microwaving plastic food containers releases cancer causing chemicals</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Sorry, but those <a href="http://www.pioneerthinking.com/ara-coldmyths.html">are</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology#Astrology_and_science">unlikely</a> <a href="http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/hairgrow.asp">to</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_in_mythology">be</a> <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/update0706a.shtml">true</a>.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of these myths floating around in conventional wisdom and email inboxes, and I think it&#8217;s important to understand how to be a rational human being in today&#8217;s world.</p>

<p><strong>How do you decide what&#8217;s true and what&#8217;s not?</strong></p>

<p>The first lesson here is to realize that just because something intuitively SEEMS true, does not mean you should believe it.  Our brains have the remarkable ability to learn from the world around us, but they can also play tricks on us.</p>

<p>For example, it&#8217;s very INTUITIVE to our brains that if you dropped a 100lb. ball and a 10lb. ball at the same time, the heaver one would hit the ground first.  But thanks to <del>Isaac Newton</del> Galileo, we now know that to be false.</p>

<p>Similarly, it&#8217;s very INTUITIVE for our brains to think of the earth as the center of the solar system with the sun revolving around it.  It &#8220;just looks&#8221; that way because the sun comes up in the morning and goes across the sky.  Copernicus eventually convinced the world the sun was at the center of the solar system.</p>

<p>By the way, both of these ideas were met with ridicule (and sometimes worse) when they came out.  Why?  It upset people because it just didn&#8217;t SEEM right.  It broke their view of the world, and people get upset when you challenge their closely held beliefs.</p>

<p>My point here is simple: just because something SEEMS true isn&#8217;t a good reason to believe it.</p>

<p><strong>Some Common Mistakes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence">Anecdotal Evidence</a></strong>
This is the most common one I see.  It basically means using a personal experience or observation to draw a much larger conclusion.  For example, &#8220;my grandfather smoked a pack a day and lived to be 95, smoking isn&#8217;t dangerous!&#8221;.  This isn&#8217;t evidence at all because it&#8217;s not a controlled study with a large enough sample size to draw any reasonable conclusion.</li>
</ol>


<p>To prove this to yourself, take something you know to be true.  For example: eating tons of unhealthy food makes you fat.  Now ask yourself if there is any specific case where this is not true?  Well, yes, there is probably SOME lucky person out there who eats a ton of food and isn&#8217;t fat.  Now if you knew nothing about food and had heard this one story (anecdote), it could be used (incorrectly) as evidence to suggest that eating lots of food does NOT make you fat.</p>

<p>Sure, in this case you would know better, but what about in more complex subjects like medicine or health?  Hopefully you can see the danger of anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>Opinions, observations, and stories are no substitute for a carefully controlled experiment (more on this later).</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Assuming Correlation Proves Causation</strong>
People also make the mistake of assuming that because A happened, and then B happened, A must have CAUSED B.  This is also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_fallacy">post-hoc fallacy</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Example: Kids are listening to rap music now (playing more video games, smoking pot, etc - take your pick) and violence is up, obviously the rap music caused it.  Well, maybe it did and maybe it didn&#8217;t.  But merely noticing that when one went up the other went up proves nothing on it&#8217;s own.  Maybe B caused A, the violence caused the rap music.  Or maybe they aren&#8217;t related at all.  Stating a correlation proves nothing about causation.</p>

<p>As stated on Skeptic.com&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>You have a cold, so you drink fluids and two weeks later your cold goes away. You have a headache so you stand on your head and six hours later your headache goes away. You put acne medication on a pimple and three weeks later the pimple goes away. You perform some task exceptionally well after forgetting to bathe, so the next time you have to perform the same task you don&#8217;t bathe. A solar eclipse occurs so you beat your drums to make the gods spit back the sun. The sun returns, proving to you the efficacy of your action.</p></blockquote>

<p>Only a controlled study can show causation, not correlation on it&#8217;s own.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Thinking It&#8217;s True Because It Can&#8217;t Be Proved False</strong>
This is called an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance">argument from ignorance</a> or logical fallacy, where you assume that something is true just because it can&#8217;t be proved false.</li>
</ol>


<p>It can also take the opposite form where you assume something is false just because it can&#8217;t be proved true.</p>

<p>Example: &#8220;You can&#8217;t prove God doesn&#8217;t exist, so God must exist.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can, again, prove to yourself that this isn&#8217;t evidence at all.  Some things are just impossible to prove false.  For example, what if I said there is a teapot orbiting the sun somewhere in our solar system.  This is ridiculous of course, because even if you looked long and hard for it, I could always say well you just haven&#8217;t found it yet&#8230;space is a big place!  It is impossible to disprove, and clearly this provides no evidence that a teapot does in fact orbit the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Part One Summary</strong></p>

<p>When you hear people say one of these, it should set off a BS alarm off in your head.  Here are some phrases to watch out for:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s real because it happened to me&#8221; (Anecdotal)
&#8220;Everyone I talked to said it&#8217;s true&#8221; (Anecdotal)
&#8220;Of course it happened after [BLANK] came in!&#8221; (Correlation/Causation)
&#8220;Well you can&#8217;t prove that it doesn&#8217;t!&#8221; (Argument from ignorance)</p>

<p>So far this article has mostly talked about what NOT to do.</p>

<p>In part two I&#8217;ll talk about what TO do: the CORRECT way to prove something, how to quickly find the truth for yourself, and a study on pigeons which will blow your mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some excellent writing on entrepreneurship came out in the blogosphere lately.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2008/10/23/the-cure-to-our-economic-problems/">this brilliant article by billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban</a>.  Here are some of my favorite quotes:</p>

<p>On why entrepreneurs are the cure for every economic crisis&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Entrepreneurs who create something out of nothing don’t care what tax rates are&#8230;The impact of tax rates on productivity and development is something economists masterbate about,  enterpreneurs don’t waste their time thinking about it. We have business to do&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>On why <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-plans-are-bullshit/">business plans are bullshit</a> and you shouldn&#8217;t borrow money to start a business&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>The best businesses in recent entrepreneurial history are those that have been started with little or no money. Dell Computer, MicroSoft, Apple, HP and tens of thousands of others started in dorm rooms, tiny offices or garages. There weren’t 100 page long business plans&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Many entrepreneurs think the next step is to take all this feedback, update their 100 page business plans and go out and raise money. It’s as if the missing link for success in a business is cash to get started. It’s not. Far more often than not, raising cash is the biggest mistake you can make&#8230;</p>

<p>There are only two reasonable sources of capital for startup entrepreneurs, your own pocket and your customers pockets. I personally would never even take money from a family member.</p>

<p>Similarly, I enjoyed <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/10/be-careful-of-w.html">this post by 7-time best selling marketing expert Seth Godin</a> on why, if you do decide to get a job, you should be very careful about it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Your boss and your job determine not only what you do all day, but what you learn and who you interact with&#8230;Work in a high stress place and you&#8217;re likely to become a highly stressed person, and your interactions will display that. Work for a narcissist and you&#8217;ll develop into someone who&#8217;s good at shining a light on someone else, not into someone who can lead. Work for someone who plays the fads and you&#8217;ll discover that instead of building a steadily improving brand, you&#8217;re jumping from one thing to another, enduring layoffs in-between gold rushes. Work for a bully and be prepared to be bullied&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>There are plenty of books about getting a job, but no books I know of about choosing a job</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Instead, start asking how you can create <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<p>Most people get it backwards.  They come up with a way to make money first, and then try to add the value in as an afterthought.</p>

<p><strong>Do you see why this is putting the cart before the horse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I want to sell subscriptions to the &#8220;premium&#8221; content of my website.  What do you think people would be willing to pay for?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;d like to write a book.  What would be a marketable topic that people are interested in these days?</p></li>
<li><p>We need to sell the next version of our operating system (<em>cough</em> vista <em>cough</em>).  What features can we add in there so people will think it&#8217;s worth it?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>When you think about making money first, it corrupts your ability to make the most valuable product because you&#8217;ve already decided your course of action.  You never stop the ask, &#8220;is this even the best way to help people?&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the reasons I think Google is so successful is that, believe it or not, they don&#8217;t focus on making money.  The most surprising thing I saw when I visited Google a few years back is that if you want to get approval to work on a new product there, you will NEVER be asked &#8220;how is this going to make money?&#8221;  They really don&#8217;t care because they know if it actually does help people do something faster, easier, or in a less painful way then it will become popular.  And there are numerous ways to monetize a popular product.</p>

<p>In fact, I was surprised that they even called them &#8220;products&#8221; because they had no plans to make money with them up front (&#8220;projects&#8221; probably would have been a better name).</p>

<p>Do you think that ever happens at traditional companies like GE, Ford, and Microsoft?  Hell no.  They are doing tons of market research, feasibility studies, price point analysis, and net present values to see if a product can make money.</p>

<p>The irony of it is that if you get the first part right and actually do create something that is valuable, the money part will take care of itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The email subscriptions for Breaking Free are handled by FeedBurner, and I&#8217;ve always wished they would provide an option to send out email updates weekly.</p>

<p>As it is right now, email updates go out as soon as a new post is made.  So about once a day if you post that much (a couple times per week in my case).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always thought this was a little too often and was afraid of annoying my readers with too many emails.  Unfortunately, FeedBurner doesn&#8217;t offer an option to send them out weekly.  I would have to switch over to another service like Aweber or Feedblitz (which is pretty bad) to get a weekly email going out.</p>

<p>So I decided to put together a little poll.  Are you getting too many email from Breaking Free?</p>

<p>Note: <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">click here if you don&#8217;t see the poll</a>, you will have to visit the actual web page.</p>

<p>[poll id=&#8221;2&#8221;]</p>

<p>Of course if you are subscribed via the RSS feed then this question doesn&#8217;t really apply to you.  By the way, if you don&#8217;t know what RSS is, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0klgLsSxGsU">this YouTube video</a>:</p>

<p>I understand some people prefer to get email updates, but I personally use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> for all the blogs I read and it is much better I think.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BreakingFree">click here to subscribe by RSS</a> if you&#8217;d like to try it out instead of email.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As requested, here is an audio recording of my talk from yesterday titled &#8220;Successfully Starting A Business On A Shoestring&#8221;.</p>

<p>You can click play below and listen to it in your browser if you&#8217;d like.  However, it&#8217;s about 45 minutes long so if it&#8217;s more convenient, feel to right click the &#8220;download&#8221; link below and download it to your hard drive.  That way you can put it on your mp3 player or listen to it in your car while you&#8217;re driving.</p>

<p>The talk was interesting because I did a few things differently.  For one thing I did not rehearse at all, and spoke for 45 minutes with no notes or slides whatsoever.  I decided to do this after reading <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1315-going-in-unprepared">this post</a> on the 37Signals blog last week, and I think it worked out well.  Some people may prefer the organized structure of slides, but I felt this talk was more personal and had more emotion in it since I was just telling stories and speaking from the heart.</p>

<p>I remember reading one time that Rudy Giuliani learned to be a good public speaker this way.  When he stopped memorizing notes and just went in and told stories from the heart, he was able to relax and connect with audiences.  Donald Trump does this also.  Even though his speaking fee is a quarter million, he will just jott down a few bullets on the car ride over and say what comes to him.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, when I saw David Brooks, the 1990 world champion of public speaking, all he did was tell stories too.  I&#8217;m sure he rehearsed but story telling is certainly powerful.  He had the audience roaring with laughter one moment, and sobbing the next&#8230;just from telling stories.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have to practice doing more of it at my next talk.  Hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and feel free to give the MP3 away or send it to anyone who you think might enjoy it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of announcements today:  First of all, please welcome our new sponsor <a href="http://www.methodologymarketing.com/">Methodology Marketing</a> with their <a href="http://www.methodologymarketing.com/">custom logo design</a> banner in the right sidebar of this page.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.methodologymarketing.com/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/picture-11.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of getting a new logo designed for your business or project, make sure to check them out.  Their prices look very reasonable.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you would like to get your own site featured on Breaking Free, you too can snap up one of those <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/advertise/">125x125 banners in the right sidebar now for JUST $15</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a ridiculous price and much cheaper than any of the other ads I sell on this site.  I lowered the price because I&#8217;m converting those ads over from affiliate ads that weren&#8217;t performing well and I want them to move, so I&#8217;m sure the price won&#8217;t be $15 for much longer.</p>

<p>Finally, if you are in Houston, I&#8217;ll be speaking at the After Hour Networking Group tomorrow Tuesday Oct. 21st at Maggie Rita&#8217;s Restaurant, 2800 Sage (SW Corner Sage &amp; Alabama, across from the Galleria).  Networking from 6-7pm, and the talk will be 7-8pm.</p>

<p>The topic will be <strong>Successfully Starting and Running a Business on a Shoestring</strong>.  Hope you can make it out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An anonymous poster asked this great question on the <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/?page_id=418&amp;forumaction=post&amp;forum=4&amp;thread=10&amp;start=0">Breaking Free forum&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Who have you taken advice from and why does their advice work for your specific type of business? It is important to figure out what exactly works for you and why, so that we can find the right path for each of us.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are my thoughts:</p>

<p>I have a simple rule for this that I try to follow: Only take advice from people who have already done it.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t have a fat trainer at the gym. But that is what most people do with business. They ask their friends and family who have never started a successful business in their lives.</p>

<p>Instead you should ask rich people. Entrepreneurs who have been successful so you can model what they did and see their mindset.</p>

<p>Regarding finding what works for you, I&#8217;ve often made the mistake of trying to do it &#8220;my own way&#8221; too soon.</p>

<p>I think when first starting out you should just copy what a successful person is doing, even if you think it won&#8217;t work or is wrong.  Only later, after you&#8217;ve become more experienced can you start to innovate and find your own style.</p>

<p>Think of it like martial arts.  You COULD come in untrained and think you will beat a black belt by doing it your own way.  And you will get creamed.  But if you study with the greats for many years, incorporating a little of each of them into yourself, then and only then after many years can you start to develop your own style.  Your own style comes later with mastery, not at the beginning.</p>

<p>Business is definitely a complex skill just like playing the violin, building a race car, or getting a black belt.  You can get the basics in probably a few years by studying the greats.  You can master it in probably a few decades or even a lifetime.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll probably be <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/?page_id=418&amp;forumaction=showposts&amp;forum=4&amp;thread=10&amp;start=0">promoting more threads</a> from the forum that I find particularly interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I went to one of the most famous barbecue places in Houston: Goode Company BBQ.</p>

<p>They are a legend in Houston, people drive from all over to get there, and there is always a line out the door.  In fact, the lines are usually so long that I&#8217;ve resorted to calling in a to-go order ahead of time so I can sneak into the shorter line.</p>

<p>After getting home with my food I was pleasantly surprised to find a small card in the bottom of the bag.  It was clean, simple, and friendly.  It asked some basic questions like &#8220;Did a staff member great you warmly upon your arrival?&#8221; and &#8220;Was your meal slow roasted to perfection?&#8221;.  After filling it out you could drop it directly in the mail (it was prepaid).</p>

<p>Is it any wonder why Goode Company BBQ is such a winner?  They actively seek feedback from their customers, even when they have lines out the door.</p>

<p>This is the same reason why when someone cancels their subscription on my tutoring site, I often immediately refund them (without them asking) and send them a personal email to ask what happened.</p>

<p>This is the same reason I installed the <a href="http://startbreakingfree.uservoice.com/pages/general?referer_type=top3">UserVoice widget</a> on this blog.</p>

<p>Constantly seek feedback from your customers, and sacrifice early profits if necessary.  It will pay off in spades in the long run.</p>

<p>Remember that for every one person who tells you about a problem, there were probably 100 others who thought it and never said a word.</p>

<p><strong>And Finally, Just For Fun&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Here are my predictions for most popular/funny/topical Halloween costumes this year:
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/328901.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/328901.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mac vs. PC guys</p></li>
<li><p>Sarah Palin (especially after Tina Fey played her)</p></li>
<li><p>Heath Ledger&#8217;s Joker from the Dark Knight</p></li>
<li><p>Hurricane Ike (at least in Houston)</p></li>
<li><p>Wall-E the robot</p></li>
<li><p>Michael Phelps</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What&#8217;s on your list of costumes to see or wear this year?</strong></p>
