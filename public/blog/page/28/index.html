  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone has an opinion, and they will usually share it with you whether you want them to or not.  Ask 10 different people how start your own business, and you will get 10 different opinions.</p>

<p>The same goes for asking advice on how to get in shape, how to find a good deal in real estate, how to make a good sales pitch, how to throw a good party, how to make a good website, how to etc&#8230;</p>

<p>So what is good advice and what is bad advice?  Who should you listen to?</p>

<p>One of the most important things I ever learned is this: only take advice from people who have <strong>already done</strong> what you are trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s fine to listen to people you meet, theres no reason to be rude, but don&#8217;t put much faith in what they tell you unless they&#8217;ve already done it themselves.</p>

<p>I think if you take a hard look at where you&#8217;ve been getting most of your beliefs about building wealth for example (parents, teachers, friends, media), they aren&#8217;t good sources by this standard.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say that your goal is to be worth $10 million.  Are your parents worth $10 million?  Was your economics professor in college worth $10 million?  Is your buddy Steve at work worth $10 million?  Is the person who wrote that article in Forbes magazine worth $10 million?</p>

<p>Robert Kiyosaki makes this point about who you should listen to in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0751532711?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0751532711">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s amazing how often you run into someone who is just itching to tell you why you&#8217;re wrong.  Be careful about who you take advice from, or you could very easily end up just as unsuccessful as they are.</p>

<p><strong>Where have you been getting advice in your life?</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/806684_measure_it1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/806684_measure_it1-150x150.jpg" alt="Testing The Sales Page" /></a>It&#8217;s time for a follow up to see how effective my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/a-1-page-ranking-on-google-and-a-redesigned-sales-letter/">sales page redesign</a> was from a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>First lets take a snap shot of the two weeks prior to changing the sales page, July 11th through July 25th.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>685</strong> Unique Views of the <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">sales page</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>21</strong> Books Sold</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3.1%</strong> Conversion Rate</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll skip the 26th since that was the day I made all the changes.  So let&#8217;s look at July 27th through August 9th (almost a full two weeks) as the next snap shot:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>314</strong> Unique Views of the new sales page</p></li>
<li><p><strong>8</strong> Books Sold</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2.5%</strong> Conversion Rate</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Most people will jump to an incorrect conclusion when seeings numbers such as these.</p>

<p>This is a great example of how important it is to really test.  If I had just been watching the sales come in I would have had the impression that things were much worse (21 sales down to only 8).  But we quickly see that far more people viewed the page in the two weeks prior to the new page going up.  This was mostly due to the link from <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/">CopyBlogger.com</a>.  In fact, about half of those 685 visitors came on the one day (the 24th) when CopyBlogger released the article.</p>

<p>But at least we have the conversion rate to help us compare apples to apples right?  Well, sort of.  If you ever took a statistics class you may remember that we need a large enough sample size before we can draw any reasonable conclusions about which performed better.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/_2006_03-march_07_pictures_01a-coinflip1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/_2006_03-march_07_pictures_01a-coinflip1-150x150.jpg" alt="Coin Flip" /></a>To understand this, imagine flipping a coin to see how often heads vs. tails comes up.  Suppose you flipped the coin three times and got 2 heads and 1 tail.  If you stopped your testing there, you would have to conclude that heads comes up 66% of the time and tails comes up 33% of the time, which we know is incorrect.</p>

<p>What if you had flipped heads 3 times in a row?  You&#8217;d have to conclude that you get heads 100% of the time, which is equally ridiculous.</p>

<p>So the larger your sample size in statistics, the more confident you can be about the results.  With only 3 tosses, you aren&#8217;t very confident about your results.  But if you flipped the coin 100 times, you can be much more confident.  After all, how unlikely is it to get heads 100 times in a row?  (That was meant to be a rhetorical question, but for you analytical types, yes it is 0.5 to the hundredth power.)  With 100 tosses, it&#8217;s pretty likely you&#8217;d get something close to 50/50 which is the correct result.</p>

<p>Anyway, for examples beyond a simple coin flip, the math gets tougher, so I like to use this website called <a href="http://www.splittester.com/">SplitTester.com</a> to do it for you.  You can plug in your data (21 and 3.1%, 8 and 2.5% in my case) and it will tell you how confident you can be about your results.  In my case, it tells me my confidence interval is low.</p>

<p>As a preliminary result, it looks like the numbers are very close to being the same.  But it looks like more testing is required before a conclusion can be made about which was better!  Continually test&#8230;but be careful about jumping to conclusions.</p>

<p><strong>Do you test your sales pages and if so how?</strong></p>

<time datetime="2007-08-02T15:16:46-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 2<span>nd</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-11.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-11-150x150.jpg" alt="How To Analyze A Killer Real Estate Deal" /></a>Today I want to tell you about a real estate deal I&#8217;m working on, and how I analyzed it.</p>

<p>First, I set up a <a href="http://search.har.com/MyHomeFinder/dispLogin.cfm">saved search</a> on my local <a href="http://www.har.com">MLS website</a> (your city probably has one too).  In the search I told it to let me know about all 3 bedroom 2 bath houses that were less than $85,000 and more than 1,888 sq.ft.</p>

<p>Why do that?  Because 85,000/1,888 = $45.  I was telling it to let me know about every house that was $45 per square foot or less, meaning cheap and usually not in great shape.  I wanted to find a foreclosed house that was selling for 60 or 70 cents on the dollar so that I could fix it up.</p>

<p>The saved search notifies you each time a new home fitting that description is listed, and yesterday it sent me list of about five homes.</p>

<p>For each of those five properties, I wanted to answer three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How much could this home sell for if I fixed it up?</p></li>
<li><p>How much could I rent it for and would it cash flow?</p></li>
<li><p>How much will it cost to fix it up?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>To answer these questions, I used a tool called <a href="http://www.lifestylesquest.com/">Quest</a> which generated the screen shots below, but if you don&#8217;t want to pay for Quest you can also do this type of analysis yourself by manually searching through your MLS and putting the data into Excel.</p>

<p><strong>1. How much could this home sell for if I fixed it up?</strong></p>

<p>This particular house I was looking at had an asking price of $76,000 and was 2181 square feet ($34/sq.ft.).  To answer the first question I sought to find comparable homes (&#8220;comps&#8221;).  A good comp is one that has the same number of beds and bath, is about the same size, is in the same neighborhood, was build in about the same year, and was sold in the past 12 months or so.  If you can find similar houses that sold recently, you can be fairly confident that your house will sell for about the same price.  Other foreclosure properties are not good comps; you want to find homes that are in good shape and represent what yours will eventually look like after its fixed up.</p>

<p>Here are the comps I found which show an estimated value of the property of about $116,000.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/sales-comps91.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/sales-comps91-150x150.png" alt="Sales Comps" /></a></p>

<p>All the comps are in the same neighborhood, within + or - 250 sq. ft., built within + or - 8 years, 3 bed 2 bath, and sold in the past 12 months.</p>

<p>This is what initially attracted my attention.  With an asking price of $76,000 and a potential sales price of $116,000, there is $40,000 in equity to be earned.  If my repairs cost less than $40,000, I can make some money.</p>

<p><strong>2. How much could I rent it for and would it cash flow?</strong></p>

<p>Just like I can find sales comps to see how much a property would sell for, I can find rental comps to see how much it will rent for.  Similar search criteria can be used.  Here are the 3 rental comps I found:
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/rental-comps2341.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/rental-comps2341-150x135.png" alt="Rental Comps" /></a></p>

<p>It looks like it could rent for about $1100 per month.  I now have enough information to calculate the potential cash flow (for now I have to assume that the repairs will be about $10,000, but I&#8217;ll investigate this further in the next step).
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/cash-flow871.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/cash-flow871-150x150.png" alt="Cash Flow" /></a></p>

<p>$243/month is the estimate for cash flow.  And the deal could get $29,000 in equity.  Not bad!</p>

<p>Note that I&#8217;m doing a zero down deal here.  The lender I&#8217;m working with will loan 80% of the after repair value.  So if it does get to $116,000 as I hope it will, they will loan me up to 80% * 116,000 = $92,800 to purchase the property and do the repairs.</p>

<p>Doing a zero down deal might not be available to everyone, but even if you needed to put 10% down on the property, the numbers still look pretty good.</p>

<p><strong>3. How much will it cost to fix it up?</strong></p>

<p>With just the information I&#8217;ve collected so far, I&#8217;d feel comfortable making an offer on this property, even without seeing it in person.  It has plenty of equity, and appears to cash flow; this deal probably won&#8217;t last long!  If I couldn&#8217;t schedule any time to see the property for a few days, I&#8217;d most likely submit an offer sight unseen to tie up the deal.</p>

<p>Some people freak out about making an offer sight unseen, but I can always back out later by using an &#8220;option period&#8221;.  For about $100 I could get an option to buy the property in the next week which would give me more time to investigate the repair cost, and allow me to back out just in case the repairs were way more than I thought.  Making an offer doesn&#8217;t mean I have to fully commit to buying it, but I don&#8217;t want anyone else to get it first.</p>

<p>However, I was lucky in this case in that i had some free time in the afternoon and the property was fairly close to where I live.  I decided to go by and take a look before making the offer.</p>

<p>On the way I called the listing real estate agent to see if someone could be there to show the property or if they&#8217;d give me the lock box combination, but it was a no go on such short notice.  Luckily, just as I was hoping, the back door was open (this happens surprisingly often on foreclosure properties, the sliding glass doors or locks are often broken).  So I was able to sneak inside to take a peak ;)</p>

<p>The kitchen was in decent shape except that the microwave had been torn out.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-51.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-51-150x150.jpg" alt="Kithen" /></a></p>

<p>These pictures don&#8217;t due justice, but the carpets and walls were pretty filthy.  The occasional busted light fixture highlighted the place.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-31.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-31-150x150.jpg" alt="Light Fixture, Walls, Carpet" /></a></p>

<p>The yard was generally overgrown and there was some standing water in one corner (perhaps poor drainage or a broken pipe).
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-61.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/08/hr1897471-61-150x150.jpg" alt="Back Yard" /></a></p>

<p>Oh yeah, and the AC unit was completely busted (there were literally pieces falling off on the ground).  There was also one wall with some exposed 2x4&#8217;s that need to be fixed.</p>

<p>Overall, these pictures make it look better than it really was, but still&#8230;the damage was cosmetic.  New carpet, paint, microwave, AC, and repairing that one wall&#8230;and this place was going to look great.  I think painting the garage door white would improve the curb appeal as well.</p>

<p>My repair estimate of $10,000 was probably about right.  Maybe $15,000 if things got worse.  I could call in a contractor for a free estimate, but based on other estimates I&#8217;ve gotten on similar properties I feel pretty good about the repair cost.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and made the offer.  Cash flowing $200 per month, and pulling $29,000 out of this deal after it was fixed up would feel pretty good.  If my offer is accepted I&#8217;ll call in an inspector before committing to buy.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for future updates!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some quick updates&#8230;.</p>

<p>My mother (yes, she reads this blog) let me know today that I achieved a #1 page rank for the very competitive keyword &#8221;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=home+based+business&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">home based business</a>&#8221; (currently at #8)!</p>

<p>This has been a few months work that finally paid off, especially as part of my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">30 day marketing challenge</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, a few days ago I redesigned the <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">sales page for my book</a> based on an <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/landing-page-makeover-2/">extensive critique I had done</a> (you can see the before pictures there).  I&#8217;ll report back on the change in conversion rate in about a week or two once there is enough data to make a reasonable conclusion.</p>

One of them is the CEO of the largest commercial real estate firm in Houston, and I&#8217;m also working with a whole group of investors at <a href="http://www.luinc.com">LifeStyles Unlimited</a>, several of which own thousands of units and are multi-millionaires.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not an experienced investor yet (working on my second deal now), but here are a few misconceptions I had about real estate that have been completely shattered for me lately.</p>

<p><strong>Myth #1: Debt is bad.  Pay off your mortgage so you can own your property!</strong></p>

<p>Most of us have heard this since we were little.  Don&#8217;t get into debt!  This statement was true, but it didn&#8217;t tell the whole story.</p>

<p>You see, <em>consumer debt</em> is what can be bad.  We have a nation full of people who can&#8217;t pay off their credit cards driving around in cars they can&#8217;t afford, and it&#8217;s terrible thing.</p>

<p>But in investing, debt is actually a good thing because it gives you an incredible power called leverage.  Let&#8217;s say you put $10k down to buy a $100k house that earned $200/month in cash flow.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d get $200 * 12 = $2,400 per year on your $10k investment for a 24% return.</p>

<p>But if you put 20% down instead or slowly paid off the mortgage over the years until you had $20k in the property.  You get the same cash flow of $200/month but $2,400 on $20k is only a 12% return.  That&#8217;s half as good.</p>

<p>The more of your money that&#8217;s tied up in the property, the worse return you will get.  Any time you can borrow money at a <em>lower</em> interest rate, and use it to get a <em>higher</em> rate of return, you should stay in debt.  Debt is a great tool for building wealth.</p>

<p><strong>Myth #2: Repairs, Maintenance, and Unforeseen Expenses Will Make Your Cash Flow Far Less Than You Think And The Deal Unprofitable</strong></p>

<p>Sure you can&#8217;t plan for everything, but people make these out to be much scarier than they actually are.  The common story goes something like this:  You buy that same rent house that pays you $200 in cash flow each month, but six months later the air conditioner breaks and you&#8217;ve got a $3,000 expense.  That wipes out your gains for 15 months!</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are some ways to get around that.  Here&#8217;s how&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you buy the property, rehab it and put in a brand new air conditioner.  When rehabbing, you can finance the cost of the AC (so it&#8217;s not your money).  If it comes with a 5 year warranty and you sell the property in a few years, then your risk is zero.</p></li>
<li><p>With a fully rehabbed property and all new stuff, why not have the renter sign a lease that states they pay for all maintenance?  The idea being that everything in the house is new, so if something breaks in the next year, they must have broken it.  Not every prospective tenant will want to sign this, but someone will.  After all, it&#8217;s a nice place at the right price.  Now you have no maintenance costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, it&#8217;s important to note that cash flow is not the entire picture for making gains in real estate.  Even if the cash flow is zero or negative, the deal might still work out great in terms of capital gains, which brings us to the third myth&#8230;.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Myth #3: I Can&#8217;t Find Property That Cash Flows So It&#8217;s Not Worth Buying Anything Right Now</strong></p>

<p>First of all, you probably <em>can</em> find deals that cash flow if you learn from the right people.  (I&#8217;ve been finding a couple each day in Houston based on what I&#8217;ve been shown.)  But lets say you can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say that $200/month deal I mentioned earlier ends up netting you $0/month or even -$100/month.</p>

<p>Well if you are buying real estate for capital gains or &#8220;equity capture&#8221;, then getting poor cash flow or even negaive cash flow might be ok.  Just to clarify, when I say capital gains here, what I mean is that you buy the house for one price, and then it increases in value and you sell it for more a little while later.</p>

<p>When you start <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-a-board-game-like-monopoly-can-teach-you-financial-freedom/">playing Cash Flow</a>, you&#8217;ll quickly see that there is big money to be made in negative cash flow properties sometimes (new players will shy away from them, just like new investors in real life).</p>

<p>If your $100k house went up to $130k in a year, and you sold it for a $30k capital gain, then don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s worth some negative cash flow.  Would you pay $100/month to get $30k in 12 months?  I sure would.</p>

<p>But how am I going to get a house that increases 30% in value in one year?  I&#8217;m glad you asked&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Myth #4: Real Estate Only Appreciates 6% Per Year At Best (Less Right Now) And The Stock Market Gets 11% Per Year</strong></p>

<p>So how are we going to get a house that goes up 30% in one year?  Luckily, appreciation is not the only way to raise the value of a property.  In fact, I don&#8217;t think betting on appreciation is a good idea at all.  It&#8217;s a lot like trying to predict the stock market, too risky for me.</p>

<p>But if you buy a foreclosed property for 70 cents on the dollar and rehab it, then you can be quite certain you&#8217;ll get that gain.  You can look at every other property in the neighborhood that is about the same size, # of beds and baths, year built, etc&#8230;sold in the last 6 months and be pretty confident about what price you can get for it.  You can even look at pictures of those properties and get an idea of how nice the rehab needs to be.</p>

<p>These deals are out there, I&#8217;m finding them myself in the last few weeks.  Now if the property happens to appreciate 6%, then it&#8217;s a nice bonus and you get more.  But if the property goes down 6% then the deal still works.  It does not depend at all on appreciation.</p>

<p>Of course, with regards to comparing real estate to the stock market, this myth is wrong for another very big reason.  That 6% increase they&#8217;re talking about is on a much bigger number.  If you put $10k down on a $100k house, you get the 6% increase on $100k, not $10k.  Thats $6,000.  But if you took that same $10k investment and bought stock that went up 11%, you&#8217;d only get $1,100.  That is the power of leverage at work.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am still figuring this all out for myself, and I&#8217;m sure some readers will disagree with what I&#8217;ve said.  There are a million opinions out there on real estate investing and one thing I strongly believe is that you shouldn&#8217;t take advice from anyone who isn&#8217;t already DOING what they are TEACHING.  I have not yet become a millionaire from real estate investing, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  But I do recommend you go out and get some mentors who are millionaires in real estate investing like I did.  You may discover that some closely held ideas you have are really just myths.</p>

<p><strong>What closely held ideas about investing and real estate did you have in the past that you now know are incorrect?</strong></p>

Right now I&#8217;m relaxing by the pool with my laptop and my only goal for the entire day has been to cook some pan cakes, watch some Entourage, and go to a birthday party tonight.</p>

<p>But I thought I&#8217;d take a minute to write a quick post here about a game I&#8217;ve been playing lately called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KIELPC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000KIELPC">Cash Flow</a> (aff).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an educational board game created by Robert Kiyosaki, of Rich Dad Poor Dad fame, that is designed to teach you financial literacy.  People get intense when playing it, pulling out calculators, and negotiating deals&#8230;sort of like monopoly on steroids.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t recommend buying the game, because it&#8217;s expensive and you&#8217;ll probably have trouble finding people who want to play it with you anyway, but you may want to check if there is a cash flow <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> group in your area that plays it.</p>

<p>When I first played it, I underestimated how complex it was (it seemed too easy).</p>

<p>But it actually does a great job of teaching you balance sheets, income statements, evaluating deals, and the difference between investing for capital gains vs. cash flow.</p>

<p>Before playing the game, I understood all of those concepts enough to pass an exam in school.  But after playing the game a few times, I feel like I understand it one level deeper.  Enough to use those terms in casual conversation and even think one level beyond, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Take a minute to find a group that plays it in your area&#8230;.it will change the way you think about getting out of the rat race.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/831441_relaxing_at_the_beach1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/831441_relaxing_at_the_beach1-150x150.jpg" alt="Passive Income" /></a>I like to think a lot about passive income.  That&#8217;s the ultimate dream right?  To just travel the world, focus on whatever you feel like, and pick up a check each month from your investments or business.</p>

<p>Robert Kiyosaki makes a great point about this in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446677477?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0446677477">Cash Flow Quadrant</a> (aff), as have many other authors, that just because you&#8217;re self-employed it doesn&#8217;t mean you are financially free.  Many entrepreneurs end up buying themselves a job - sure they don&#8217;t have a boss, but they are still putting in 10-12 hours per day.  (Typical examples include shop owners, or businesses where you are the primary talent, like consultants, etc).</p>

<p>But, I&#8217;m starting to realize that it&#8217;s not a clear answer most of the time whether income is passive or not.  It typically exists along a spectrum, and I like to find out where it is on the spectrum by asking this question: <strong>If you were to disappear to Tahiti, how long would you continue to earn money?</strong></p>

<p>Here are some examples along the spectrum&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A blue collar job</strong> - only paid when you clock in, you don&#8217;t get paid for even 1 minute you aren&#8217;t there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A white collar job</strong> - you could sneak in late or take a long lunch (a few hours), but you also get time off for sick leave, and vacation&#8230;so a few weeks in some cases</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mom &amp; Pop shop owner</strong> - You&#8217;ve got to be there each day to open and to close, so typically no more than a day or two if you can get someone to cover for you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mom &amp; Pop shop owner with management (or kids)</strong> - once they get management, they make a lot less money, but could potentially disappear for a few weeks to a month.  The problem is that if you leave for much longer than that, the business will start to deteriorate.  Theft, dirt &amp; grime, laziness of employees, etc start to creep in.  Only what&#8217;s measured gets done.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-employed business owner</strong> - this is like my tutoring business&#8230;it would continue to earn money for a month or so if I disappeared, but income would steadily decline as I wasn&#8217;t bringing in new clients, sending paychecks, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Owning real estate that you manage yourself</strong> - Could last six months probably without you doing anything, but it may not be prudent to do so.  Tenants would call with repairs, could miss rent, etc.  Some upkeep is required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Owning real estate with a management company</strong> - Could disappear for a year or so and the checks would continue to come in.  You may need to be called once in a while for massive repairs, lawsuits, or insurance claims (fairly rare events).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Passive investor</strong> - As a passive investor (think large appartment buildings, shopping centers, hedgefunds, REITS, stocks, LLC&#8217;s, LLP&#8217;s, etc)  you could literally disappear for several years, having never seen the business, and you wouldn&#8217;t need to feel guilty.  It&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s job to manage the project day to day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handing all your money to a financial planner</strong> - again, several years.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is part of the reason I&#8217;m transitioning more and more into real estate right now (it has other factors like rate of return and tax benefits that I think make it better than stocks or typical financial planner type investments too).</p>

<p>Some of the mentors I&#8217;m working with own apartment complexes that they literally haven&#8217;t been to in years.  They don&#8217;t have a key to the place.  They wouldn&#8217;t even know how to get on the property if they had to.  Their phone number isn&#8217;t listed on any registry of people to call.  And that&#8217;s exactly how they want it!</p>

<p><strong>How long could you disappear from you current (or ideal) job, and continue to earn money?</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the conclusion of my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">30 day marketing challenge</a> where I&#8217;ll share with you some of the results; both what worked and what didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>All the graphs below show a two months range: the month before the marketing challenge started, and the month of the marketing challenge.</p>

<p>Here are the page views for the last two months.  As you can see, thing picked up substantially (and fluctuated) after the marketing challenge was started, with the biggest day being early on with 2,191 views in a day.  This was due to lots of people linking to my <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/power-napping-how-to-fall-asleep-anywhere.html">LifeHack.org article on power napping</a>.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/pageviews2341.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/pageviews2341-150x150.png" alt="Page Views" /></a></p>

<p>Here is the traffic being sent from search engines.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/se-traffic-1231.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/se-traffic-1231-150x150.png" alt="Search Engine Traffic" /></a></p>

<p>Here are the top sources of traffic overall and the top keywords.
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/sources-of-traffic1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/sources-of-traffic1-150x150.png" alt="Traffic Sources and Keywords" /></a></p>

<p>Overall I received <strong>541</strong> new RSS subscribers, <strong>20,478</strong> page views, <strong>35</strong> book sales, and <strong>198</strong> comments during the 30 day marketing challenge.</p>

<p>Here are some things that didn&#8217;t work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-21-new-video-on-youtube-creating-a-personal-balance-sheet-and-article-marketer/">YouTube video</a>.  It brought in only 7 visitors.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.shopping.com">Shopping.com&#8217;s</a> service which feeds MySimon and other similar &#8220;buyers guide&#8221; websites.  My product listing there received zero clicks.</p></li>
<li><p>The majority of my efforts were designed to build links or for other SEO purposes, and its very difficult to measure how effective these were.  Some of these helped my rankings in Google, and some didn&#8217;t, but Google prefers not to share this information for obvious reasons, so it will remain a bit of a mystery.  Like most things in life, probably only 20% of the things I did accounted for 80% of the results.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In conclusion, I think the most important take aways from this experiment are that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The single most effective way I generated traffic in the short run was by writing articles for other websites as a contributing author.  This alone contributed more than 80% of all traffic I got.</p></li>
<li><p>In the long run, it appears that my search engine optimization efforts will be the biggest provider of new traffic.  This takes longer to get going, but will most likely be even bigger (and requires less work) than writing articles.  I suspect that my efforts during the 30 day challenge will continue to pay dividends over the coming months, especially after Google&#8217;s next page rank update.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Hopefully this can shave some time off the learning curve for others trying to get a new website built from the ground up!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a question from a reader&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey Brian, quick question for you. Where are you getting your health insurance from? And how much is it running you?</p></blockquote>

<p>Thanks,
D.W.</p>

<p>Hey D.W.,</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/755991_pills1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/755991_pills1-150x150.jpg" alt="Inexpensive Health Care For Self-Employed People - Health Coverage" /></a>It turns out that finding inexpensive health care is easier than you might think, even if you aren&#8217;t working for a big company.  I personally use <a href="http://www.bcbstx.com">Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas</a> and it runs me $68/month (I can&#8217;t remember my deductible exactly but it&#8217;s a little higher than average, I hardly ever get sick).</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to say that Blue Cross Blue Shield is right for you though.  I found them through <a href="http://www.ehealthinsurance.com/">eHealthInsurance.com</a> and the entire process was relatively painless.  They made it easy to compare vendors, and I&#8217;d recommend them to anyone selecting their own health coverage (self-employed or not).</p>

<p>A lot of people talk about free health insurance as a reason to work for a big company, but the argument never really made sense to me.  For one thing, it&#8217;s not really free (it&#8217;s coming out of your paycheck in one way or another).  But more importantly, getting &#8220;free&#8221; health coverage is hardly a reason to decide what to do with 1/3 of your life.  It&#8217;s sort of like buying a car because it comes with a free oil change.  You can probably afford to get a good oil change regardless, so why wouldn&#8217;t you buy a car based on what&#8217;s really important to you?</p>

<p>Are you self-employed?  What has been your experience with health insurance?</p>

<p>By the way, please continue to <a href="http://digg.com/business_finance/10_Ways_To_Come_Up_With_A_Million_Dollar_Business_Idea">Digg this article</a> on how to generate good business ideas.  It&#8217;s starting to get some attention!</p>

<p>My three tasks for the day are&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I added the site to <a href="http://www.illumirate.com">Illumirate</a></p></li>
<li><p>I added the site to <a href="http://www.mavicanet.com/">Mavicanet</a></p></li>
<li><p>I added the site to <a href="http://www.athomedirectory.com/">http://www.athomedirectory.com/</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>These are all just other website directories that are less well known than Yahoo or DMOZ.  To be honest, it is day 30 and I have been having a hard time finding new marketing ideas!</p>

<p>In retrospect, I think 30 days is enough time to spend getting a bunch of SEO and link building done to the point where I can now focus on just posting good content to this website.</p>

<p>The foundation has been built.  Tomorrow I will make a post concluding this experiment and showing some of the results.</p>
