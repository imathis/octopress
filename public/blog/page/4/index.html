  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is from the excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430210788?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430210788">Founders At Work</a>, that I&#8217;m reading right now.</p>

<blockquote><p>I find new reasons every day why I&#8217;m thankful that we never took any kind of outside investment.  Let me give you a small example&#8230;  Jared had a friend that had an idea of some way that we could modify FogBugz to be really useful to the investment community as something - I don&#8217;t remember what, but something that the investment community could really use that&#8217;s 5 percent different than FogBugz.  And I kept thinking, &#8220;This is a huge distraction, and there&#8217;s not a big enough market.  I just want to stick to our core competency, and I&#8217;m not interested in doing software for the financial markets.&#8221;  He kept saying, &#8220;No, no.  You&#8217;ve got to talk to this guy.  You could make a lot of money off this.  It would be great.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I kept thinking, &#8220;You know what, if it was a real board of directors and the VC&#8217;s were bringing you these great ideas, you wouldn&#8217;t really have any choice but to say yes.  And you&#8217;d keep getting distracted to do their pet projects that they dreamed up in the shower one night and they think might be a good idea, and you just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea.&#8221;  You really don&#8217;t have the ability to say no when you take those outside investments.  It&#8217;s hard to tell your investors, &#8220;Let me just go in my own direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>I can identify with this thought process.  There is a big difference between thinking up a cool idea, and actually having to go implement it.  But I found it interesting because he may have <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/02/14.html">changed his mind</a> (at least in part) since he wrote this a few years back.  He went on to take VC money for his new project, StackOverflow.com.</p>

<p>This person might just  want a &#8220;new&#8221; Honda Accord and doesn&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s a 2010 or 2011.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s harder to build technology based on how humans think, but it tends to be better when you do.  Google does a great job of &#8220;understanding&#8221; what you meant with fuzzy matching, for example.</p>

<p>The example above really isn&#8217;t even that bad (some people want to choose  a year).  What other examples of &#8220;database driven user-interfaces&#8221; have you come across?</p>

<time datetime="2010-05-24T07:06:12-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 24<span>th</span>, 2010</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past week I made it over to Henderson, Nevada and took a tour of Zappos Headquarters.  I went with all the folks in the startup I&#8217;m working for, just because we thought it would be fun and we liked their approach to business.</p>

<p>I also ended up reading the new book by Zappos CEO, Tony Hsieh, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446563048?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0446563048">Delivering Happiness</a> which I&#8217;d highly recommend.  The story of how Zappos came to be a billion dollar company is filled with many twists and turns, and near death experiences.</p>

<p>I just wanted to jot down a few ideas that stuck with me from the tour and the book:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Customer service = good marketing</strong>
Zappos today is known for having great customer service.  But that wasn&#8217;t always the case.  When they were nearly bankrupt and had no money for marketing, they decided to reach out to their existing customers in the hopes they&#8217;d become repeat customers.  It worked.  Taking a $39 loss on a free pair of shoes might appear to be bad business on the surface.  But when that person told 5 of their friends, it ended up being more cost effective than $39 worth of advertising.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is a powerful idea that your customer service can actually be your best marketing.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t outsource your competitive advantage</strong>
At one point Zappos was relying on manufacturers to drop ship all the products they sold on their site.  This allowed them to carry zero inventory and run a simple business, but the orders only had about 95% accuracy and were slow to ship. It also limited the selection of what products they could sell.</li>
</ol>


<p>At some point they had to make a tough decision: if customer service is what they were all about then they needed to control the entire customer experience from beginning to end.  They made a major shift (and nearly went bankrupt) in the process of starting to keep their own inventory, but it paid off.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth spending some time thinking about what your core competency is and focusing only on that.  Once you decide what it is, you may have to sacrifice in other areas to achieve it - so you can&#8217;t make <em>everything</em> your focus.  As Jim Collins said, &#8220;If you have more than three priorities, you have no priorities&#8221;.  What are you willing to sacrifice so that you can focus on your competitive advantage?</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fun &amp; purpose > Money</strong>
Finally, one of the most interesting take aways is that Tony ended up preferring fun and purpose over money.  Even after nearly going broke trying to keep Zappos afloat, he still realized that the money wasn&#8217;t that important.  He started valuing seemingly unimportant things like hanging out with friends at work or playing pranks around the office as bigger contributors to his happiness than money.</li>
</ol>


<p>This definitely showed during their tour as there were plenty of shenanigans.  It&#8217;s surprising how once a person&#8217;s basic needs are met, money starts to become much less important than how they get along with bosses and coworkers.</p>

<p>You can check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63WFjoFiXns">Tony&#8217;s talk from South by Southwest here</a> and checkout <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446563048?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0446563048">Delivering Happiness on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you Zappos for the tour!</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just came across some really exciting material this weekend.  Apparently the biggest &#8220;school&#8221; in the world right now is run and taught by one person.  I put school in quotes because it&#8217;s not a school in the traditional sense - it is just one guy who started making tutoring videos for his cousins on YouTube.</p>

<p>1,400 videos later it is now the largest open courseware project in the world with more views than MIT, Stanford, Berkeley or any other school - and 200,000 monthly users.</p>

<p>Here is a video of Sal Khan&#8217;s talk where he discusses what the &#8220;Khan Academy&#8221; has turned into.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/11731351"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-17-at-1.26.15-AM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to dismiss this as just a web phenomenon that isn&#8217;t comparable to regular education.  After all, there is no interaction in a YouTube video so you can&#8217;t ask the teacher a question.  There are no discussions amongst students, no written papers, and no grades.</p>

<p>Yet it also comes with some non-obvious advantages.  For example, each student can go at their own pace, there are fewer distractions (each video features just a simple blackboard), and students can easily review material several times without needing to take notes.</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, <strong>a truly great teacher can now reach 200,000 students a month instead of 20</strong>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate the importance of this last point.  Imagine how many students are sitting right now, bored out of their mind, in a classroom with a sub par teacher (or worse, in a developing country without a teacher at all)?  What if they instead had access to one of the best teachers in the world?</p>

<p>The implications of that are really staggering.</p>

<p>Sal Khan is one of those people with a natural gift for teaching.  After watching the video above, I went to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy">check out his page on YouTube</a>.  What&#8217;s amazing is that I actually found myself engrossed in several topics that I hated in school.  Watching YouTube videos is just too easy!</p>

<p>And he is great at breaking complex ideas down into simple parts.  Just as an example, check out his series on banking and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy#p/p/CECDA315A8848B99/23/8SAMey9Gl5I">fractional reserve system</a>.  In just 10 minutes I feel like I understand our current financial crisis more fully.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy#p/p/CECDA315A8848B99/23/8SAMey9Gl5I"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-17-at-1.45.43-AM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>What do kids like to do when they aren&#8217;t doing their homework?  Watch YouTube videos.  Now they may be one and the same.</p>

<p><strong>Sal Khan may have just done the impossible: made learning fun.  And I&#8217;ll make a tall claim: his simple YouTube videos could actually be more effective than the vast majority of public school education that is being delivered today.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s still a new technology and not a drop in replacement for schools&#8230;yet.  But I think we&#8217;re witnessing the birth of something big here, and I&#8217;ll be watching it closely.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Warrillow sent me a copy of his book recently (one of the perks of having a business blog) and it was surprisingly good.</p>

<p>The book is titled &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0986480304?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0986480304">Built To Sell</a>&#8221; - which actually turned me off a bit at first.  It reminded me of &#8220;Built To Last&#8221;, the famous business book by Jim Collins, except quick flips have a negative connotation to me.</p>

<p>So I started it with a bit of skepticism.  But this quickly disappeared as I got into the story.  Built To Sell is told in a parable format (somewhat like Rich Dad, Poor Dad or The E-Myth Revealed) which made it really easy to read and very engaging.  I finished it within 24 hours.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0986480304?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0986480304"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-03-at-11.31.27-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The book goes through the story of Alex, a small business owner who decides he wants to sell his company one day and realizes he can&#8217;t because he has built a service business that is dependent on him.</p>

<p>Luckily he has a mentor named Ted, who takes him through the process of converting his company to one that can be sold.  This is based on mentors the author has had in real life, and it was clear from reading it that he has walked the walk.</p>

<p>It covers a bit of accounting, negotiation, business brokers, cash flow, etc.  I guess I left with the feeling that this kind of information could only have come from long meetings with lots of real mentors.  These are the kind of mistakes I wouldn&#8217;t want to have to learn the hard way.</p>

<p>Check it out if you get a chance.  After reading it, I mailed it to a friend of mine in Houston who runs a service business.  It was the kind of information I wanted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0986480304?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0986480304">share</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was reading <a href="http://bit.ly/9x5THt">this presentation by the Dropbox.com Founder</a>, Drew Houston, the other day and the most interesting part about it was that most of their marketing with Adwords and conventional approaches completely failed.</p>

<p>Yet Dropbox has over 4 million users.  So how did they do it?</p>

<p>Apparently it was almost entirely word of mouth - but they did it in a smart way.</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/9x5THt"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-25-at-12.12.31-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>You can click above to see the full set of slides (they are worth reading).  But one important point that stood out to me was the 2-sided incentive for referrals that he mentioned above.</p>

<p>I logged in to Dropbox to see what it looked like and here it is:</p>

<p>The key here is that he is giving them more <strong>storage</strong> as the reward and not <strong>money</strong>.  I like this for a few reasons:</p>

<li><p>It&#8217;s closer to what Dropbox users actually want.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s cheaper for Dropbox to give this away because they are dealing in trade.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s sort of like if you ask your friend to give you a ride to the airport, and when you get there you pull out your wallet and give him $10.  He&#8217;d probably feel insulted - it cheapens the act of kindness.  But if you give him a ride the next time he needs one, or return the favor in some other way that isn&#8217;t money, then it&#8217;s all good.</p>

<p>Sometimes money isn&#8217;t the best gift.</p>

<p>So with this in mind I started thinking about how I could improve my own site, <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com">UniversityTutor</a>.  My current referral program pays tutors $3/month to refer other tutors.  But those other tutors not only have to signup, they also have to upgrade - which only 1-2% of them do.  So it&#8217;s tough for tutors to make much doing this, and $3 isn&#8217;t very motivating.</p>

<p>This weekend I took a few hours to change UniversityTutor&#8217;s referral program to more of a Dropbox model.  The free account on UniversityTutor is based on the number of job requests you get (first 3 are free, after that you can upgrade) instead of storage like Dropbox.  So now when a tutor refers a friend they both get another free job request up to a maximum of 20.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if this is more effective than money.  My hunch is that it will be - when tutors reach the end of their free account, the conversation in their head is much more around how to get more tutoring jobs, not how to get $3.  What do you think?</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update</strong>: Yes, I&#8217;m aware that ads for TurboTax are showing up on this article occasionally, and I think it&#8217;s awesome :)</p>

<p>Tax time is definitely a pain.</p>

<p>The U.S. tax code is a lengthy document (over 50,000 pages at last count) that few people can really understand (including our current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Geithner#Tax_scandal">Secretary Of The Treasury</a> which is somewhat frightening).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s riddled with puzzling (and at times hilarious) questions such as these gems which I encountered over the weekend:</p>

<blockquote><p>Did you rent a farm and receive part of the crop instead of cash for the rent?</p></blockquote>

<p>Why yes I did!  I&#8217;m sure glad someone at the IRS thought to include this question otherwise I might have missed it.  And this one:</p>

<blockquote><p>Enter the amount of any gambling losses, but only to the extent of gambling winnings. It is important to keep an accurate diary or similar record of your gambling winnings and losses.</p></blockquote>

<p>Umm&#8230;.ok, nice to see the government giving gambling advice.</p>

<p>But I guess I can&#8217;t get too upset at the government acting very&#8230;well, government like.  They don&#8217;t know any better.</p>

<p>But a private company&#8230;well that&#8217;s another story.  And this is what I always found especially infuriating about Intuit&#8217;s TurboTax product.  It&#8217;s not just that it&#8217;s a bad piece of software - it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s bad yet so darn successful!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It gets <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb%5Fsb%5Fnoss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dturbotax%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">TONS of negative reviews</a> on Amazon.com, but since there are over 40 different versions listed (they put up new ones each year) their bad reviews keep getting pushed down.</p></li>
<li><p>It has &#8220;designed obsolescence&#8221; - which means they went out of their way to break it every year so you&#8217;d have to buy it again.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s user interface looks like it was designed by programmers and accountants instead of normal people.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is why I was so excited to see someone finally come along and clean TurboTax&#8217;s clock.</p>

<p>The last two years I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.TaxACT.com">TaxACT.com</a> and it is a breath of fresh air.  It is fast, clean, simple, and makes sense out of incomprehensible IRS documents (perhaps their most impressive feat).</p>

<p>By the way, I&#8217;m not getting paid to recommend them.  They are just that awesome that I wanted to tell people about it.</p>

<p>Best of all, it is way cheaper than TurboTax.  Filing your federal return is FREE.  If you want to do a state return it&#8217;s just $9.95.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m so impressed with these guys - they nailed a great freemium product, probably put up with TONS of hassle getting it to work with the IRS, and have a product that really beats the pants off TurboTax.</p>

<p>Even if you have been using TurboTax for YEARS, it&#8217;s time to BREAK the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R706isyDrqI">addiction</a>, stop paying your money to Intuit each year for their inferior product, and make the switch to <a href="http://www.TaxACT.com">TaxACT.com</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently posted some screenshots of some <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/behind-the-scenes-numbers-from-universitytutor-com-revenue-expenses/">internal dashboards</a> I built a while back at UniversityTutor.com.  These are fun and addictive to check each day, but they can also serve an important purpose in your business of keeping you motivated and helping you spot trends.</p>

<p>Here are some cool dashboards I&#8217;ve spotted around the web lately:</p>

<h2>1. The Panic.com Dashbaord</h2>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/04/statusboard.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/04/statusboard.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Gorgeous design.  Tracks daily signups across their various products, plus support queues, daily revenue, local bus schedules, upcoming events, and twitter mentions.</p>

<p>They also mounted it on their wall with a flat panel display which make it great as a rallying point around the office.  More info on <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/">their blog</a>.</p>

<h2>2. The Tumblr.com Dashboard</h2>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-04-at-10.55.42-PM.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-04-at-10.55.42-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Tumblr shows some nice stats on their public about page.</p>

<h2>3. The CulturedCode.com Dashboard</h2>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-04-at-10.53.32-PM.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-04-at-10.53.32-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Has a train station motif going on.  Nice work.</p>

<h2>4. The Google Dashboard</h2>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/04/google.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/04/google.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I visited the Google offices recently and they have this dashboard in their lobby which shows the locations of Google searches happening in real time.</p>

<p>I also remember reading a story about Amazon in their early days where they setup a dashboard internally that rang a bell every time they made a sale.  So they could even incorporate audio (a &#8220;cha-ching!&#8221; sound whenever you make a sale).  It was a great way to help the team celebrate small victories.</p>

<h2>So how do you get one of these for your own business?</h2>

<p>These dashboards are beautiful, but they are all custom built and take quite a bit of programmer time.  So for the last few weeks I&#8217;ve been thinking about building a web site that helps people create dashboards like this.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like it to be an open framework that is easy to build on top of.  This way, designers all over the world can submit their own dashboards based on the API and backend, and there would be some really creative stuff come out of it (just like Facebook opened their platform to let people create Facebook apps, or Wordpress let anyone create &#8220;themes&#8221;).</p>

<p>There are still lots of technical details to work out on a project like that, but I&#8217;ve started looking into it.  If you have any thoughts, as always feel free to let me know in the comments&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is pretty cool.  Was looking at the stats recently for FeedmailPro.com and about 600,000 messages (blog posts going to email subscribers) have gone out since it started just six months ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/03/mailgraph.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2010/03/mailgraph.png" alt="" />
</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>306 blogs with 132,844 total subscribers are now using the service</p></li>
<li><p>9 paying customers so far which is a 3% conversion rate on a freemium product</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The main untested theory behind the site, which is that you can let users import subscriber lists without another opt-in by <a href="http://feedmailpro.com/faqs/1">testing the list first</a> seem to be working quite well.  You can weed out spammers without punishing the good guys.</p>

<p>It has also saved people a lot of money who have switched from Aweber.com.  I was previously paying $70 per month to manage the email list for this blog and one other with Aweber, so in the past 6 months FeedmailPro.com has saved me $360 just by switching.</p>

<p>Maybe it can do the same for your blog?  If you&#8217;re looking for a more versatile email newsletter for your RSS feed (at a fraction of the cost) <a href="http://feedmailpro.com">check out the site</a>.</p>

<p>There is also an <a href="http://feedmailpro.com/faqs/4">affiliate program</a>.</p>
