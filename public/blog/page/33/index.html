  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sharon wrote in to tell me about this <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/moneymag/0706/gallery.success_stories.moneymag/index.html">article</a> from Money Magazine that discusses 8 entrepreneurs and the businesses they started.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t help feeling a little strange after reading through.  Are these really good examples of companies one should start?  Some of them seemed like poor choices that spent way too much to get started.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does the world need another smoothie shop?  I imagine you&#8217;d have much greater success starting a Jamba juice or Smoothie King franchise then trying to reinvent the wheel.</p></li>
<li><p>Why does it take $200k to start a board game company?  Couldn&#8217;t you get prototypes made for a couple hundred dollars (at least enough to show at trade shows and get your first orders?)</p></li>
<li><p>The chances of succeeding when opening a chocolate shop seem slim.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Sandy Webster seems to be one of the few in the group who <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/moneymag/0706/gallery.success_stories.moneymag/4.html">bootstrapped</a> correctly.</p>

<p>What this article demonstrates to me is that even if you take a mediocre business idea, you can still be successful if the owner is incredibly passionate.  Personally, I&#8217;d rather start with a less risky idea, but anything is possible!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-27.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-27-150x150.png" alt="Technorati" /></a>It&#8217;s day 4 of my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/16/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">marketing challenge</a> where I&#8217;m demonstrating how to build traffic to your business website.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I just finished reading John Reese&#8217;s <a href="http://www.income.com/blog/2007/06/18/heres-the-big-secret-to-becoming-an-internet-millionaire/">article</a> on working with others to grow your business, and it sparked some ideas.  I sent off two interview requests to successful entrepreneurs that I know (one has already accepted).  Hopefully they will be appearing on this site over the next week or so.  I realized that offering an interview is a great way to get great content other than my own thoughts, and it also will help build traffic because typically the interviewee will tell others about their interview!  In many cases they even link to it from their own website.  Thats what I call win-win.</p></li>
<li><p>I ran the site through some tools at <a href="http://www.seomoz.org">SEOMoz.org</a>.  Unfortunately it looks like most of their tools are part of their paid service now, but I was able to uncover and fix one problem with my meta tags showing incorrectly on the homepage.</p></li>
<li><p>Installed the <a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior">Ultimate Tag Warrior</a> plug in for WordPress.  This improves meta keywords by offering suggestions, and should improve rankings in the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> blog search engine.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/725875_calculator1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/725875_calculator1-150x150.jpg" alt="Engineering" /></a>I&#8217;ll be reposting some articles from my newsletter over the next few weeks, starting with this one:</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;d like to talk about the skillset required to start a business.  Specifically, do you need to have a background in engineering?</p>

<p>I hear this used most frequently as an excuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just too technical for me to understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was never good with numbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Things have changed so much since I was in school.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, these are just that: excuses. I&#8217;m here to tell you that engineering is not only NOT required to start a successful business, it could actually hurt your chances!  And this is coming from someone who has their degree in engineering!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Engineers are preoccupied with what is possible and what isn&#8217;t.  Entrepreneurs don&#8217;t care what others consider possible, and frequently attempt the impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>Engineers are focused on the present.  They have a problem in front of them and they solve it.  Entrepreneurs are focused on the future.  They see the problem in front of them as a minor distraction on the way toward a larger goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Engineers feel that if they can make the best product, the company will be successful.  Entrepreneurs realize that it is often the company with the best marketing and financial statements that wins, not necessarily the best product (sad but true).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I&#8217;ve never seen an official study done, but historically speaking, pure engineers who start companies don&#8217;t do too well. Nikola Tesla, the inventor of AC electricity and the radio, Charles Goodyear, who made the first rubber that could be used year round, and Johannes Gutenberg, who created the printing press, all died without a cent to their name.</p>

<p>If you happen to be clueless when it comes to technical subjects, don&#8217;t despair.  You can always pay someone to do the things you don&#8217;t know how to do.  And it&#8217;s getting cheaper everyday. (check out www.elance.com or www.guru.com)</p>

<p>If you are a brilliant engineer who is interested in becoming an entrepreneur, then there is also hope for you.  Simply realize that technical work has very little to do with running a successful company, and devote yourself to learning the skills of business: marketing, communication, and cash flow, to name a few. Your engineering background will still serve you as an advantage, but it won&#8217;t be a key to your success.</p>

<p>Most entrepreneurs realize at some point that their time is much too valuable to be spent on the everyday technical problems. Don&#8217;t let your educational background (or lack thereof) hold you back from starting a business!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we are on Day 3 of my 30 day <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/16/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/">challenge</a> to bring more traffic to this website.</p>

<p>Today I:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reinstalled <a href="http://www.linkmachine.net">Linkmachine</a> which helps build reciprocal links (where you and another website link to each other to help improve search engine optimization).  I had it on my old website and hadn&#8217;t ported it over yet to my new site.  Reciprocal links are important because they establish credibility with search engines.  I had a number of links on there to page rank 4 websites and better.</p></li>
<li><p>I set up a <a href="http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer">Google Website Optimizer</a> test on my <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/?page_id=24">book</a> sales page.  I used <a href="http://websiteoptimizer.contentrobot.com/">this plugin</a> for Wordpress which made it easier, although I&#8217;m still working out one bug with it.  Specifically, I&#8217;m testing the Guarantee section which promises a refund to see if I can improve it.  I&#8217;ll continue to post results of these sort of tests over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I submitted this marketing challenge article series to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/">ProBlogger</a> in the hopes that Darren will post a link to it.</p></li>

<p>My three tasks for the day were:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Finished another article for <a href="http://www.lifehack.org">lifehack.org</a> which will appear in the next week or so.  I&#8217;ve become a regular contributer there and it has helped drive traffic through my &#8220;about the author&#8221; section at the bottom.  This has actually been the biggest contributor so far, and is a technique I talked about in <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/12/the-top-five-ways-to-market-your-business-for-free/">this</a> video.  I need to try and become a contributing author for some other big blogs.</p></li>
<li><p>I submitted <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/?page_id=24">Breaking Free</a> to Amazon.com today.  Hopefully it will appear in a couple days.  I also formatted and uploaded image files to Amazon&#8217;s servers so that they will appear in search results.  Once the book appears, I&#8217;m going to get the copy text on their page edited, send an email to everyone who has purchased it so far to ask them to leave a review, and mail Amazon a physical book so they can scan it for their Search Inside program.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I read <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seomoz.org%2Fblog%2Fguide-to-traffic-from-digg-comments&amp;ei=Bgx2Rq26EpL0qALnjqXxDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9oPepYyrka8s7zJv0v-zkJdPuaQ&amp;sig2=RkQY7OIC_IJolrQTwO7mcA">this</a> article a while back about generating traffic from Digg comments, so I tried that today.  I left four comments on upcoming business related stories that were valuable but also included a link to my site.  One problem I encountered is that digg doesn&#8217;t allow HTML links in their comments, so my links were just plain text (meaning someone would have to manually copy and paste it or type it by hand, they couldn&#8217;t click it).  I&#8217;m not sure if this is something Digg has changed recently or not.  I will need to get more of my stories submitted to Digg in the future as well, since they are a major source of traffic.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Side note: as a result of switching to FeedBlitz I had about 20 people unsubscribe, probably just because it was confusing and annoying to see that email go about about the switch (I don&#8217;t blame the reader who shouldn&#8217;t know or care about such technical details, Feedblitz required it).  I should have sent the post about the upcoming switch BEFORE it took place, so lesson learned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Checkout this great <a href="http://www.bestsellerinterviews.com/10-questions-with-seth-godin-author-of-permission-marketing-purple-cow-and-the-dip.html">interview</a> with NYT Best Seller and marketing expert, Seth Godin.</p>

<p>He makes a few important points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>58% of Americans never read another book after high school</p></li>
<li><p>The average American purchases one book per year, and probably doesn&#8217;t get through the entire thing.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s far easier to reach 1000 people today with a YouTube Video, or Blog, than it is with a book.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Keep this in mind when trying to spread your idea, product, or service.  How can you remove as many barriers as possible to help it spread?  It&#8217;s far easier for someone to email a link to their friend, than it is for someone to remember your book title, drive to a bookstore, spend their hard earned money, and find time to read it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the first day of the marketing challenge.  Here are the three things I got done today.  These aren&#8217;t the sort of real traffic building activities I&#8217;d like to get to, but are more like pre-requisites to get the site together properly.</p>

<ol>
<li>I moved the email newsletter service from <a href="http://www.zookoda.com">Zookoda</a> to <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com">FeedBlitz</a>.  There were a few reasons for this, namely that Zookoda is really buggy and appears to have no-one supporting or correcting it anymore.  It&#8217;s a shame because they had the best service out there (and it was free), but a little neglect here and there and the whole thing became unusable.  They must be focused on other activities. Feedblitz is quite good as well, but costs some money.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you see an email from FeedBlitz, don&#8217;t be alarmed.  Hopefully this change will allow the email newsletter to operate smoothly and draw people to the website with excerpts that grab their attention, and entice them to click &#8220;Read More&#8221;.</p>

<ol>
<li>I did some SEO.  Namely installing the <a href="http://www.brandonbuttars.com/2007/03/29/wordpress-meta-tags-plugin/">MetaTagz</a> and <a href="http://www.netconcepts.com/seo-title-tag-plugin/">SEO Title Tag</a> plugins.  And I finished going through some old posts to update the description, keyword, and title meta tags.</li>
</ol>


<p>This will hopefully help the pages rank higher in Google over time to bring in more traffic.  SEO is an important part of building any business website.  It can get complicated and boring, so in most cases I suggest outsourcing to have a pro do it.  Your time is better spent elsewhere.</p>

<ol>
<li>I installed the post series plugin, which you can see at the end of this page.  It helps generate more links for a series of posts so people keep reading longer.</li>
</ol>

I intend to put my money where my mouth is and demonstrate that live in front of you, quickly turning this into a profitable website.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to do a little marketing challenge to help build traffic.  Each day for the next 30 days, I will complete at least 3 tasks to market this website.  My goal is to build traffic, get more subscribers, and sell books&#8230;.but more importantly it is to prove that anyone can make a profitable website with a little dedication.</p>

<p>This challenge is in the spirit of Steve Pavlina&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/">30 days to success</a> and <a href="http://www.journeypage.com/">Journey Page</a>.  It also follows with the idea of making goals measurable and timely (having a deadline) which great authors have been talking about for years.</p>

<p>Each day I&#8217;ll post about what was done.  How much can be accomplished in a month?  We shall see.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no shortage of tasks to work from.  For starters, I&#8217;ll be doing some SEO, taking some ideas from <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/08/15/search-engine-optimization-for-blogs/">Problogger</a>, this <a href="http://www.authorityblackbook.com/reese/">ebook</a> on traffic building, and many others sources.  Suggestions are always welcome.</p>

<p>The first day of the challenge will be today, Saturday the 16th of June, 2007.  The challenge will end the 16th of July, 2007.  Let the games begin!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/jack_welch1.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/jack_welch1-150x150.jpg" alt="Jack Welch" /></a>I have to respectfully disagree with Jack and Suzy Welch in their recent Business Week <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/mediacenter/podcasts/welchway/welchway_05_25_07.htm">article</a> about what&#8217;s required to start a company.</p>

<p>His message essentially boils down to this: you need a good idea.</p>

<p>He goes on to talk about the horrors of starting a business, including disappearing time, money, freedom, etc, and says that it&#8217;s all for nothing if you don&#8217;t have a good idea.</p>

<p>This advice is wrong, and heres why:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First off, saying &#8220;you need a good idea&#8221; is about as helpful as saying &#8220;you need to work hard&#8221;.  Duh.  It&#8217;s banal and impossible to disagree with, yet at the same time not very helpful to someone trying to start their first business.  They already knew that was important, but the problem is that&#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>First time entrepreneurs don&#8217;t KNOW what is a good idea and what isn&#8217;t.  You can read books, talk with mentors, etc&#8230;but until you actually start a business, you won&#8217;t really know.  You have no experience to base your decisions on.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, even the perfect business idea won&#8217;t succeed if you have no idea what you&#8217;re doing.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you wanted to become a great race car driver, would you wait around for the perfect race car before getting on the track?  Of course not, because even the greatest race car in the world with an inexperienced driver behind the wheel won&#8217;t win races (and will probably crash).</p>

<p>So what do you do?  You get started with any old race car you can find so you can start practicing going around the track.  As you build experience (and maybe even crash the first few cars) you slowly get better and better until one day you AND a good race car are well matched and end up winning.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never met a single person starting their first business who was sure it would work, and if they listened to Jack Welch they would never even try.  But the people I know who were successful tried their idea out even though they weren&#8217;t sure, and learned a lot because of it.  The key is to fail <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/12/the-top-five-ways-to-market-your-business-for-free/">quickly and inexpensively</a>, and then pick yourself back up to try again - it is the #1 learning tool at your disposal.</p>

<p>Besides, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Welch">Wikipedia</a>, Jack Welch hasn&#8217;t done any startups worth mentioning.  The man is brilliant as a manager, but I have to disagree with him in this case.</p>
