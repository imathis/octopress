  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason at the gym last night I started thinking about tax brackets and how totally ridiculous they are.</p>

<p>Sure, I understand the idea that &#8220;people who make more should contribute more in taxes&#8221;, but do you realize this is already accomplished with a simple percentage?  Let&#8217;s say everyone paid 20% of their income to the government and this was the only tax bracket.  Well, 20% of $50,000 is half as much as 20% of $100,000.  It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s fair - someone who earned twice as much would contribute twice as much in taxes.</p>

<p>But instead, we have tax brackets.  We are in effect telling people that if you work hard, start businesses, own real estate, break free, create jobs,  stimulate the economy, and start to earn a lot of money - we (the government) will punish you by taking an even greater percentage of your money.  Similarly, if aren&#8217;t doing anything currently which people are willing to highly compensate you for - you will be rewarded by the government taking less of your money!  How is this any different than punishing success and rewarding failure?</p>

<p><strong>The dirty little secret about tax brackets</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a more subtle point that many people don&#8217;t realize.  Due to tax brackets and inflation, the government will continually get more of your money even without raising taxes.  Allow me to explain&#8230;</p>

<p>Inflation occurs each year and makes your money worth a little bit less.  Many companies give a standard raise each year of about 3% to each of their employees if they haven&#8217;t done anything particularly spectacular or terrible because it is expected.  This raise doesn&#8217;t actually make them any richer in term of purchasing power - they can still buy about the same amount of stuff they bought last year because everything is a little more expensive.</p>

<p>BUT, while salaries are continually creeping up due to inflation (without anyone getting richer), tax brackets don&#8217;t creep up with inflation.  They stay set.  That means there are millions of Americans each year who get bumped into a higher tax bracket (without being any richer) just due to inflation - and the government gets a bigger percentage of their money.</p>

<p>This means politicians can literally say &#8220;I will not raise taxes!&#8221; yet still get more of your money even after adjusting for inflation.  Tricky!</p>

<p><strong>A problem of marketing</strong></p>

<p>Getting widespread adoption of an idea like this strikes me as primarily a marketing problem.  This concept of no tax brackets is currently known as a &#8220;flat tax&#8221;.  They need to come up with a better name for it because the name suggests &#8220;no matter how much you earn you will pay the same amount in taxes&#8221;.  This sounds totally unfair - and of course is not at all how it works (as I mentioned above, under a flat tax someone who makes twice as much would pay twice as much in taxes).  But that&#8217;s certainly how it sounded to me when I first heard it.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d have to make the distinction between the <em>percentage</em> being the same while the <em>actual dollar amount</em> of taxes you pay changes drastically.  Unfortunately, I&#8217;d venture to guess that a relatively small percentage of the population TRULY understands this concept to the point where it wouldn&#8217;t bias them.</p>

<p>Just like the &#8220;estate tax&#8221; never had widespread opposition until they started calling it the &#8220;death tax&#8221;, I think the &#8220;flat tax&#8221; needs a name change.  I&#8217;m not sure what it would be (the &#8220;fair tax&#8221;?  the &#8220;let&#8217;s not discourage success and be idiots tax&#8221;?).  Who knows, all I know is that I can&#8217;t think of any real justification for having tax brackets and it seems totally unethical.</p>

<p>I should also mention that I am currently in a pretty low tax bracket and have nothing to gain from a flat tax - in fact I&#8217;d probably end up paying more.  I do however work like crazy and hope to some day be filthy rich by contributing massive amounts of value to the world (isn&#8217;t this incentive the very basis of all innovation and progress for mankind?) and it bothers me that this incentive is being undermined.</p>

<p><strong>So what do you think?  Is there any justification for having tax brackets?  Are we just rewarding failure and punishing success?</strong></p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I attended the Web 2.0 Venture Forum at Rice University in Houston, TX.  It was awesome!</p>

<p>I got to see about 54 new companies present their ideas to venture capitalists and try to get money.  I took a bunch of pictures and video for you.</p>

<p>While I <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1142-advice-for-entrepreneurs-throw-out-that-five-year-plan-build-something-now-and-dont-take-any-money">don&#8217;t believe in taking venture capital</a>, especially for a Web 2.0 business, I did really enjoy seeing a whole bunch of new business ideas and meeting a bunch of entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;453&#8221; caption=&#8221;Brian Armstrong at the Web 2.0 Venture Forum&#8221;]<img src="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v646/221/68/3002642/n3002642_31792508_6272.jpg" alt="Brian Armstrong at the Web 2.0 Venture Forum" />[/caption]</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p>Some of what I&#8217;m about to say might sound negative.  I believe in encouraging people to pursue their ideas in business and take action, so the people who presented deserve a lot of credit.  But in my opinion a lot of VC&#8217;s giving feedback at this conference were way too polite.</p>

<p>That isn&#8217;t what these entrepreneurs needed to hear and that&#8217;s not fair to them.  They need to hear your real opinion even if it&#8217;s harsh.  Some of the most valuable and time-saving business advice I&#8217;ve ever gotten was when somebody (the <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-worst-mistake-you-can-make-when-asking-for-advice/">right kind of person</a>) told me my idea sucked.  So I&#8217;m not going to hold back here.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some of the highlights for you&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>The First Four</strong></p>

<p>These were the four &#8220;main&#8221; companies who went first.  They had 15 minutes each while everyone else had only 90 seconds.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.nutshellmail.com">Nutshell Mail</a></strong>

<p>If you have a lot of different email accounts this service will consolidate them by giving you a summary in one of your inboxes.  The business model is ad-supported.  I didn&#8217;t see the value in this and it strikes me as <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/are-you-creating-a-product-that-nobody-needs/">solving a problem that doesn&#8217;t exist</a>.  A better solution to this already exists: set up auto forwarding of your old accounts to your GMail account and use their multiple accounts feature to run everything from Gmail.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rudder.com/">Rudder.com</a></strong>
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-32.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-32.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This service emails you personal finance updates about all your bank accounts, credit cards, etc to give you ACTIONABLE information and a general financial picture.  These guys might be on to something.  I&#8217;ve been saying for years <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/">how awful Quicken is</a> and the market is ripe for the picking.  Newcomers like <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint</a> and <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">Wesabe</a> got so close but never delivered the most inportant part: ACTIONABLE information.  They just said &#8220;what pretty graphs can we make?&#8221; instead of giving people the 2 or 3 pieces of information they really wanted (cash flow, net worth, etc).</p>

<p>Anyway, if (and it&#8217;s a big if) Rudder.com can accomplish this they might be on to something big.  It&#8217;s not easy to code connections to all the hundreds of different types of accounts people have, so it&#8217;s a big project, but I wish them the best.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.gendaigames.com/">GendaiGames</a></strong>
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-41.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-41.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This company is trying to make it easy for anyone to create games.  Basically they&#8217;ve made some software which takes the programming out of it with a simple graphical user interface, and makes a community where people can upload the images and sounds that you can use in the game.</p>

<p>I like the idea, but there is a big hurdle to this business: the trade off between how easy the game is to create and how good the game is.  This is what happened when people came out with &#8220;no programming!&#8221; tools to create webpages (also known as WYSIWYG editors like Frontpage and Dreamweaver).  Sure, it allowed anyone to make a webpage, but the webpages weren&#8217;t all that great.  You&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a top 1,000 site on the internet today what was created in Dreamweaver or Frontpage.</p>

<p>So anyway, my thoughts on this company are - &#8220;if you can do it great, but I&#8217;m skeptical that it&#8217;s possible to create good games in a generic app like that&#8221;.  From looking at their demo they are still only able to create the most basic flash games - but in their defense they are still working on it.  We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.moximity.com/">Moximity.com</a></strong>
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-51.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-51.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>These guys made an iPhone app that shows local data (restaurant reviews, etc) and is ad supported.  Good idea, but the problem is that they got all the reviews from <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp.com</a> and just threw some ads on top of it.  Why wouldn&#8217;t people just use Yelp.com and avoid the ads?</p>

<p>Yelp.com has created something of real value (a community of users, a large database of places and rewiews, etc).  They also have their own iPhone app which is quite good.  So they are in control - they are the one with the real value which is the community and userbase.  Moximity has added some other features such as a social networking component that allows you to see your nearby friends.  But I can&#8217;t see Moximity.com having any success with this when the main value of it comes from Yelp.com and they have added some ads on top.  Even if the ads are really coupons - I think you&#8217;d have a hard time making the case to users that this is an added value for them.  This is a classic case of <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/stop-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-get-money-from-people/">focusing too much on making money instead of focusing on how to create something of real value</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Keynote From Google App&#8217;s Evangelist Jaime Casap</strong></p>

<p>This was the best talk of the day in my opinion.  Jamie covered not only Google&#8217;s mission and approach to products, but made a compelling case for the next wave of internet users who will be using the products you create.  These people are&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Young</p></li>
<li><p>From developing countries (India, China, Brazil, etc..)</p></li>
<li><p>More concerned about helping others and being part of a community than traditional status symbols</p></li>
<li><p>Way more computer literate than you are</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Also, surprisingly only about 18% of people in the world are online and only about 10% of the world&#8217;s information is online.  We have a long ways to go.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v646/221/68/3002642/n3002642_31792571_7964.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v646/221/68/3002642/n3002642_31792511_822.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Myself and Jaime Casap after the talk.  I&#8217;m always impressed with the talent Google has on it&#8217;s team.  It was clear to me that Jaime was one of the few people at this conference who really understood Web 2.0 and where it&#8217;s going.  A lot of the MBA and VC types are still stuck in an old fashioned way of thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Panel of Bloggers</strong></p>

<p>Apparently there are a lot of other great startup bloggers around Texas that I didn&#8217;t know about.  These guys did a panel on the changing environment of startups and venture capital money.</p>

<p>Check out&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dean McCall from <a href="http://www.ideagin.com">Ideagin</a></p></li>
<li><p>Bryan Menell from <a href="http://www.austinstartup.com">Austin Startup</a></p></li>
<li><p>Alex Muse from <a href="http://www.texasstartupblog.com">Texas Startup Blog</a></p></li>
<li><p>Josh Tabin from <a href="http://www.startuphouston.com">Startup Houston</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>They did a great job and I wish I&#8217;d gotten a chance to meet them afterward as fellow bloggers.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t find them!</p>

<p>One thing that did surprise me was the amount of money being talked about at this conference.  At one point in the panel they said something like &#8220;the days of getting $4 million in funding are over&#8230;take a look at what some of these companies have done with just a couple hundred thousand dollars.  That&#8217;s the new landscape and that&#8217;s what you need to do too!&#8221;</p>

<p>I almost fell out of my chair when I heard this.  We&#8217;re talking about a couple guys getting a website thrown together.  That was LITERALLY all these &#8220;companies&#8221; were.  To me a couple hundred thousand is absurdly high.  It made me realize how different I am from the mainstream MBA/VC crowd when I am out there telling people how to <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/46-ways-to-start-a-business-with-no-money/">start a business for $100</a> and do it in <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">one month</a>.  If you are just developing a website - partner with a developer and give them some equity.  Don&#8217;t rent an office or hire employees or any of that junk.  Do some viral marketing campaigns.  Your only cost should be your time and $10/month in web hosting.  You should be embarrassed to have spent $100k on a &#8220;business&#8221; which is nothing more than a website and hasn&#8217;t seen a dime in profit yet.</p>

<p>ANYWAY, I digress&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>The Three Best Companies I Saw</strong></p>

<p>Here are my picks.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.pluraprocessing.com/">Plura Processing</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-61.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-61.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>These guys developed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing">distributed super computer</a> - similar to SETI at home if you are familiar with that - except this one is deployed through the web so it can reach a ton more people.  They claim to already have the 10th largest super computer in the world based on current users.</p>

<p>The only concern I see with this is the perception of security - a lot of companies that use super computers like drug companies and financial firms - have intellectual property they want to protect.  So they won&#8217;t be too keen on the idea of their data being processed on thousands of computers around the world.  I think in reality it will be very secure (after all each computer is only doing a tiny piece of a much larger project, so it would be practically useless even if you DID manage to break the encryption).  So this will be more a matter of changing perception at stodgy old firms than actual security risk - but still a hurdle.</p>

<p>Even so I bet they will get some big customers - really innovative idea, I hope these guys succeed because they&#8217;ve got a great idea on their hands.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.lessnetworks.com/">Less Networks</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-71.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/12/picture-71.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Everybody loves free wi-fi but for some reason it is still pretty hard to come by in most cities.  These guys have a plan to get more free wi-fi out there by making it ad supported.  Basically, when you connect to a node you&#8217;ll get a branded welcome screen, you&#8217;ll have to enter your email, then you see another branded confirmation page - and you are free to surf the net.  Since they know (at least roughly) your geographic location they can make the ads more targeted.  They just landed Miller Brewing as their first customer and they&#8217;re partnering with phone and cable companies who have the infrastructure.  Sure - the ads might be a bit annoying and you&#8217;d have to give them your email, but for free Wifi, a ton of people would do that!  Brilliant idea - I&#8217;d love to see more free wi-fi around the U.S.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rudder.com">Rudder.com</a></strong></p>

<p>This is the company I mentioned at the beginning.  I think they could have something big on their hands if they execute it correctly.  Basically, creating people&#8217;s financial statements for them automatically each month and delivering them by email.</p>

<p><strong>Video of Presenters</strong></p>

<p>In this (rather shaky) video I took you can see some <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/2509548">90 second pitches by various presenters</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/2509548">Web 2.0 Venture Forum - Dec. 11th, 2008 - Rice University</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user1032888">Brian Armstrong</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed going and it was a long day.  My biggest take aways were&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Venture capital is almost entirely unnecessary for Web 2.0 companies.  They shouldn&#8217;t be asking for it!</p></li>
<li><p>The ideas about how to inexpensively start a business are way off for most people in the MBA/VC community.  <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/9-businesses-i-started-which-utterly-failed/">9 out of 10 ideas aren&#8217;t going to work</a> so people need to go through them quickly and inexpensively.  It is ridiculous to spend a couple hundred thousand dollars to get a website created.</p></li>
<li><p>There is probably too much focus out there right now on ad-supported business models.  This is a nice fall back but I don&#8217;t think it should be relied upon as much.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t sugar coat your advice - you are doing a disservice to entrepreneurs when they want your real opinion.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/are-you-creating-a-product-that-nobody-needs/">real problem</a> and if you don&#8217;t have a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-analyze-a-new-business-idea/">MAJOR benefit over an incumbent</a> don&#8217;t even try (there were too many people trying to copy YouTube and Facebook).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Hope this was useful to everyone.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep Breaking Free!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of entrepreneurs are freaked out about telling people their business ideas.  They act like it&#8217;s a big secret that someone will steal!</p>

<p>Usually there is no need for this.  Great business ideas are abundant, it&#8217;s the execution of them that is really difficult.</p>

<p>For example, we all know that if someone could create a super fuel efficient car, or a machine that washed and dried your clothes in one step, or an operating system that never crashed - they&#8217;d be rich!  Those aren&#8217;t secrets, they just happen to come with difficult execution.</p>

<p>You aren&#8217;t the only one with your business idea.  Lot&#8217;s of people have had it.  It&#8217;s just that 90% of them will never act on it, and of those that do, 90% of them won&#8217;t get it right.  Maybe (hopefully) you will!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You probably hear good business ideas on a regular basis.  But how do you know if they&#8217;ll be right for you?</p>

<p>Here is a quick checklist I like to go through to analyze a new business idea and decide if it&#8217;s right for me.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Would it solve a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/are-you-creating-a-product-that-nobody-needs/">real problem</a> or am I fixing something that isn&#8217;t broken?</p></li>
<li><p>Could I be the best in the world at it (at least in this niche)?</p></li>
<li><p>Will it be inexpensive and quick to test out in case it doesn&#8217;t work?  (remember, 9 out of 10 of your ideas <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/9-businesses-i-started-which-utterly-failed/">probably won&#8217;t work</a>, and that&#8217;s great - it&#8217;s the only way to succeed - just try to do it fast and cheap)</p></li>
<li><p>Am I passionate enough to make it through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841666?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591841666">the dip</a> or will I lose interest in six months?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Regarding #2, I usually just Google it to check out the competition.  Keep in mind that people can become very comfortable with their old, regular way of doing something.  There is a cost to them of switching to your new service.  Even if yours is a little bit better they still have to spend their time and brain power learning a new system and taking the risk that it might not work for them.  They might not even think to LOOK for an alternative if their current system is &#8220;good enough&#8221;.</p>

<p>So you can&#8217;t just be a little bit better - a prettier color scheme for example.  You have to be &#8220;enough better&#8221; that it&#8217;s worth it for them to switch.  The best situation you can find is one where most people hate the only available solution, and are actively searching for an alternative.</p>

<p>This is the case with accounting software like Quicken and Quickbooks, for example.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished listening to Tim Ferriss&#8217;s <em>The Four Hour Work Week</em> for the second time on audio book and I have to say it&#8217;s outstanding.</p>

<p>If I had to pick one book on entrepreneurship that came out this year, it would probably be this one.  You owe it to yourself to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307353133?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307353133">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that Tim is perhaps the best in the world at, is what he likes to call lifestyle design.  This is basically the idea that that you can be extremely mobile and just do incredibly fun stuff all the time.  It sounds simple, but how many of us actually have brand new, exciting/scary experiences in life on a regular basis?  Exactly.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what so great about entrepreneurship: if can give you this lifestyle that most people only dream about or give up 40 years of their life to get.</p>

<p>Anyway, Tim has a new show coming out (it&#8217;s a pilot actually) where he attempts to master a new skill that would normally take 5-20 years in just 1 week.  This could be a new language, martial arts, dancing, etc.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://tr.im/1rak">trailer for the show here</a>:</p>

<p>The show will be on <strong>December 4th (tomorrow)</strong> at <strong>11pm ET, 10pm CST, 9pm MT, and 11pm PST</strong>.  Set an alert to check it out.  Tim will be holding a live Q&A; on his blog after the show if you have questions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day when I <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-i-reached-2000-subscribers-on-this-blog/">posted</a> about breaking the 2,000 subscriber mark, Breaking Free reader Caleb, of <a href="http://www.thesoldiermillionaire.com/">http://www.thesoldiermillionaire.com/</a>, asked a very good question that I thought deserved some more attention:</p>

<blockquote><p>Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>You say it took you about a year before your blog picked up momentum.</p>

<p>If you were to start a new blog all over again now, from scratch, but knowing what you now know, how long do you think it would take to reach the same number of subscribers/revenue? (No cheating by using your old blog to direct traffic to your new blog.)</p>

<p>I am curious about how much of it is “skill and knowledge” vs. how much is “17-month gestation”.</p>

<p>Here is my response:</p>

<p>Hi Caleb,</p>

<p>That’s a good question. I think it could go a bit faster the 2nd time around.  Here are the three things I wish I had known before I got started - most of them dealing with choosing the right blog topic:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pick a topic that has mass appeal - great way to do this is to browse magazines in Barnes &amp; Noble. If there is a magazine dedicated to it, it probably has enough people interested to make a good blog topic.  Spend some time in Barnes &amp; Noble&#8217;s magazine rack if you are trying to brainstorm ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick something that you&#8217;re passionate about so that it will be easy to continue writing.  It should be a topic you&#8217;d write about whether anyone was reading it or not (like a journal) because it will feel like this for at least the first 6 months.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick something that you have the potential to be the best in the world at someday.  The #1 blog in a particular niche doesn&#8217;t receive 3 times more traffic than the #3 blog.  It&#8217;s probably more like 100 times the traffic for being #1.  Even if you aren&#8217;t an expert now, that&#8217;s ok.  Writing about your journey to learn a topic is great.  But you should at least have the potential to be the best some day.  If someone else already has a blog out there on a topic that you like, that&#8217;s ok.  Your niche can be local, or be a different take on the same subject within reason, as long as you have the potential to become the best.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>One final bonus tip on how to grow a blog faster: Be opinionated. Take a stance in your posts and say what everyone else was thinking but didn’t have the balls to say. I think I was too afraid of offending anyone when I first started so I took the middle road and played it safe in my posts.  This is a good way to have a boring blog that is not worth reading.  When you&#8217;re opinionated you will piss off some people but you will also win loyal followers.  This is far better than being boring which will get you no readers.  Plus some of the people you piss off will still continue reading your material anyway.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to speak your mind.  People admire true honesty and authenticity because it&#8217;s rare on the internet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The easiest products to sell are those that solve a BURNING desire.  What do people lay awake at night thinking and dreaming about?  What do they have an intense fear or irrational fantasy about?</p>

<p>The three most popular are probably these:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Health</strong> If you can barely get out of bed, have an intense headache, or worse yet&#8230;have several months to live, what amount of money WOULDN&#8217;T you be willing to give to make it go away?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wealth</strong> Everyone has irrational fears and fantasies regarding money.  It keeps us up at night.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relationships</strong> Everyone has a strong desire to be loved.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>A lot of first time entrepreneurs make the mistake of creating a product that people don&#8217;t DESPERATELY need.  They create something that they think is cool, but no one else even knows to look for.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a book about their life story.  Maybe they want to become a fashion consultant.  Maybe it&#8217;s a dog grooming service.</p>

<p>Nobody lays awake at night thinking &#8220;GOSH if only I could find a better dog groomer my life would be better!!&#8221;.  No, they are thinking about how they can be skinnier, richer, and get the cute guy/gal at work to notice them.</p>

<p>Even if people do spend money occasionally on non-essential products and services, these are the first expenses they cut when money gets tight or the economy goes down.</p>

<p>Of course health, wealth, and relationships aren&#8217;t the only ones.  People have incredibly strong emotions regarding their children, politics, sports, sex, etc.  These strong emotional reactions are what you&#8217;re looking for because they cause people to buy (it&#8217;s not as much logic as we&#8217;d like to think).</p>

<p>Whenever possible, it&#8217;s better to check whether people actually want the product BEFORE creating it.</p>

<p><strong>How to know if anyone is looking for what you&#8217;re selling:</strong></p>

<p>A quick way to check is with the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal">Google Adwords Keyword Tool</a>.</p>

<p>In just a few seconds you can find out that 300,000 people each month search for dog grooming services.  But this pales into comparison to the 1.4 million searches each month for tutoring.  That in turn is outpaced by the number of people searching for help with back pain at well over 2 million.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/11/stats1.png"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/11/stats1.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll have an easier time if you pick a market where people are already desperately searching for a solution to their problem!  It&#8217;s much harder to create something that no one knows about, and later try to convince them that they need it.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!
