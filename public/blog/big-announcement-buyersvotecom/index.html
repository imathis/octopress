<p>Here is the description from the <a href="http://buyersvote.com/about">about</a> page which describes the site:<a href="http://buyersvote.com"></a></p>

<p>=====================================</p>

<h3>Friends help you make buying decisions every day&#8230;</h3>

<blockquote><p>This phone is great!</p>

<p>That mechanic is a crook!</p></blockquote>

<p>We know we can trust our friends (unlike advertisements) because they aren&#8217;t selling us anything.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you could ask a friend about EVERY product you wanted to buy before you bought it?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be even better if dozens or hundreds of people could tell you about their experience with it and any related products too? One person might be biased or get it wrong but surely if you could AVERAGE the reviews of hundreds of people you could know which was best.</p>

<h3>The power is now in YOUR hands (the consumer)&#8230;</h3>

<p>The internet has enabled consumers from all around the world to COLLABORATE - sharing their collective experiences to let each other know what is good and what is bad.</p>

<p>Online reviews are nothing new of course. You can find a great book on Amazon, a great hotel on TripAdvisor, and a great digital camera on CNet - all from reading opinions of real people who have already used the product.</p>

<p>But what about the myriad of other products that DON&#8217;T have a dedicated, trusted, portal on the web?</p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t searching for a major consumer good on a website you already trust, you&#8217;ll often get back junk pages full of affiliate links, biased reviews by one person, or endless forum posts that you don&#8217;t have time to read and summarize.</p>

<blockquote><p>What if there was a site that was <strong>community editable</strong> - just like Wikipedia - so that ANYBODY and EVERYBODY could create reviews for any product they wanted?</p></blockquote>

<p>And what if it was completely free?</p>

<p>What I have just described of course is BuyersVote.com - a community editable site where anybody can create and edit pages for any product, service, or company in the world.</p>

<p>A trusted, portal site can now be formed for <strong>niche products</strong>, <strong>mainstream products</strong>, <strong>local products</strong>, <strong>individual service providers</strong> and anything else that people or companies want to rate and review.</p>

<p>Imagine&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Choosing a bank, credit card, or cell phone company based on thousands of votes from their real customers</p></li>
<li><p>Doctors and hospitals making more informed purchases of medical equipment</p></li>
<li><p>Accountants collaborating to choose the right software</p></li>
<li><p>Finding the right lawyer, wedding planner, plumber, or realtor in your neighborhood based on reviews from actual customers</p></li>
<li><p>Companies being able to choose the right vendors and suppliers based on past performance</p></li>
<li><p>Mothers rating private schools</p></li>
<li><p>Motorcycle riders rating biker bars</p></li>
<li><p>Exotic pet lovers describing their favorite species of tarantula</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The sky is really the limit here.</p>

<blockquote><p>People and businesses have millions of different interests, needs, and areas of expertise. Now they have a place to read and create trusted reviews on ANY topic they&#8217;d like.</p></blockquote>

<p>They could even end up creating a way to rate things which aren&#8217;t products (charities, blogs, speakers at a conference, etc). That is part of the beauty - BuyersVote so open ended that I have no idea WHAT people will do with it and that is great.</p>

<p>YOU are in control on this site, YOU are the editor, and YOU can create whatever you&#8217;d like.</p>

<h3>Quality Control And Reputation</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve also taken things one step further than Wikipedia by building a reputation system - a quality control if you will - right into BuyersVote.</p>

<blockquote><p>When you make an edit or post a review on BuyersVote, other users will be able mark your contributions as helpful or not. Over time, you will build a reputation on BuyersVote (the little number by your username) which is an indication of how much the community trusts you.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is great for a few reasons. First, it means that the community is &#8220;self-policing&#8221;. If a malicious user tries to deface a page or insert their opinion where facts should go (a major problem on Wikipedia), the community will vote them down and their editing privileges will be removed.</p>

<p>Second, it means that well trusted contributors will gain new privileges and will essentially be full administrators of BuyersVote. They will be able to delete pages, flag them, re-categorize them, combine them, etc.</p>

<h3>Consumer Reports, Wikipedia, and the Better Business Bureau In One</h3>

<p>One of the most exciting parts about this website for me personally is the idea that it can not only help good companies rise to the top and be rewarded - but also that it will ensure bad companies get punished and won&#8217;t be able to keep taking advantage of new consumers.</p>

<p>Almost everyone has had a BAD experience at some point in their life with a product or service. Maybe it was a piece of junk and they refused to honor the warranty. Maybe it was an individual or company who took your money and never delivered the result.</p>

<p>Taking them to court can be a hassle, so you might be stuck - only able to warn your friends about it and share your story. The company might lose one or two new customers (depending on how many friends you have) but chances are they wouldn&#8217;t feel the effect and would go right on doing the same thing to other people.</p>

<p>But what if you had several MILLION &#8220;friends&#8221; who could now read about your experience online? What if when people typed the company&#8217;s name into Google your review came up at the top? I bet that shady company might start to listen.</p>

<blockquote><p>The next time a company or individual treats your poorly, do the world a favor and make a PUBLIC RECORD of your experience on BuyersVote.com. Let the world know how you were treated and you might just save someone else the same fate!</p></blockquote>

<p>If we all work together we can actually eliminate unethical companies by making this information freely available. Bad companies will either have to clean up their act or go out of business once it&#8217;s public knowledge how bad they really are.</p>

<p>In fact, I suggest that when creating a page on BuyersVote you use the individual or company&#8217;s REAL NAME. If their name is John Smith and they are a realtor, make a page for them called &#8220;John Smith (Realtor)&#8221;. If they are a company, write their actual company name.</p>

<p>Why? Because when someone does a Google search for this person or company&#8217;s name, you want your review to come up first telling the world to beware.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts&#8230;</h3>

<p>By no means should BuyersVote ONLY be a negative place for bad reviews. It should also be a place to highlight the BEST in any field and help people make the right buying decisions.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people and companies in the world are good and I hope the site will reflect that. Overall I&#8217;m very excited for what BuyersVote.com will become.</p>

<p>Remember that&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>BuyersVote is a &#8220;wiki&#8221; just like Wikipedia - meaning that anyone can create or edit a page on this site</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone can write a review on this site</p></li>
<li><p>BuyersVote is 100% FREE</p></li>
<li><p>The next time you need some information on what to buy, do a search for it here first</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a specific interest or experience (good or bad) with a certain product, service, or company - create a page for it</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Thank you so much, and I&#8217;ll see you around BuyersVote!
Brian Armstrong</p>

<p>=====================================</p>
