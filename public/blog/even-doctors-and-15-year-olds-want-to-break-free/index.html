  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent some time digging through my emails tonight and updated the <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">book page</a> with about a dozen emails from people who purchased <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">Breaking Free the book</a>.</p>

<p>Some of them are pretty inspiring&#8230;and it&#8217;s amazing to see the VARIETY of people who all share the same desire to be free from a job (from doctors to 15 year olds).</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy them as much as I did&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey! I just finished your book, and although I&#8217;m not writing to thank you for the vast changes it has brought up in my life JUST YET- I feel the need to tell you that I completely enjoyed every sentence of the book.</p></blockquote>

<p>There were many parts where I couldn&#8217;t help but smile because it was clear how you genuinely wanted the absolute best for the reader - you weren&#8217;t worried about how silly things might sound as long as you got your point across or as long as it worked (like punching the little &#8216;self doubt creature&#8217; off your shoulder hahah). I also loved the stressed importance of not ripping off your customers or &#8216;being evil.&#8217; You seem like a great person and I&#8217;m genuinely happy that you&#8217;ve reached this success because you seem like you totally deserve it.</p>

<p>Take care!
Juliet</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>Big fan of your blog. Bought your ebook a couple of days ago and I think it&#8217;s great! Congratulations for a job well done.</p>

<p>One of the posts that I find very inspiring is your &#8220;From Idea to Launch&#8221; post series. Mainly because it shifted my paradigm that online business = information products.</p>

<p>[Specific question removed]</p>

<p>-Carlo</p>

<p>PS. FYI, in &#8220;Breaking Free&#8221;, Afterword was spelled Afterward (don&#8217;t know if that was intentional) and you have a typo on page 229 for your email address :D Yes, I got to that within just a couple days of reading.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I am a doctor, and this was the only way I could see myself functioning in this world.</p>

<p>You gave me the courage to &#8220;start breaking free&#8221; away from the path, which no longer was led by my desire, but rather by inability to turn back on something into which I have invested so much. I am not sure this mail will reach you, but I want to thank you and wish you success in everything you do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kind regards,Katie</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Hey Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I actually thought this was a pretty good book.  This is the first full eBook that I have bought, and I have to say that I was very impressed.</p>

<p>The concepts are well thought out and presented in a very clean manner that helps for easier understanding and retention.</p>

<p>I bought this book at the same time as 4-Hour Work Week (by Timothy Ferriss) and these two books are now two books that I am recommending to people over everything else.</p>

<p>I think the ideas presented in your book are very reasonable and there should be no problem implementing them, especially using the &#8220;small steps&#8221; guideline.</p>

<p>Thanks for a good read and plan for &#8220;Breaking Free&#8221;..
Tom</p>

<blockquote><p>Brian,
I finally finished Breaking Free last night.  It was good; I liked the no-nonsense advice.  The message I especially took away from it is: &#8220;this is not that hard to do.&#8221;  I just wanted to share with you some of the things that I&#8217;ve started doing as a result of your book and some of its spin-off activities:</p></blockquote>

<p>[goes on to list 9 activities&#8230;]</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for helping me get started on this path; I&#8217;ll let you know how I&#8217;m progressing.  Let me know if you&#8217;re ever in Boston!
- Dave</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I am half way through the book so far (probably need to take you up on that speed reading suggestion) and have started playing around with Wordpress.  Thank you so much for putting the info out there that you do.  I am at a point in my life  (I turn 30 in November) where I know I need to start working for myself&#8211;the employee world is just not for me.  It is exciting but scary.  I am still working on pushing myself harder.</p>

<p>I am really glad blogs and e-books like yours exist!  They do wonders for encouraging me.  One of the things you wrote that really set off a bell was the &#8220;no matter what&#8221; ;-)   I have two Masters degrees and kind of just followed a path for a while of getting a good education and going to work for a co. with benefits&#8211;blah, blah&#8230;it&#8217;s not my destiny. I know I cannot waste my whole life dreading work in the morning.</p>

<p>Thanks!
Christine G.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hello Brian,
I met you at the after hour networking event with Jon King and bought your book. Enjoying it!
This information is such valuable stuff especially for the new business builders. Thank-you so much for sharing!
- Faye DeSilva</p>

<p>Hi Brian -</p></blockquote>

<p>Just writing to let you know that I really liked the book. It is quite a value for the money and it had some helpful advice I had not encountered before. (and I&#8217;ve read a lot on the subject)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in the process of trying to break free right now. I&#8217;m a very successful engineer at a top company, published author, and I  consider myself a smart and capable guy. Starting the process is difficult at times, but reading the experience of someone who has broken free has been very inspiring.</p>

<p>Thanks
Addis</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey dude, love your book. (im 15 by the way). I want to have my own web designing company but I really wouldn&#8217;t know where to start.  Its really good from the beginning on how you started out. I can feel the experience myself though because im more of a business person too.</p></blockquote>

<p>Looking forward to speaking with you once more and maybe in reality!</p>

<p>-Jarod B.</p>

<blockquote><p>Your eBook is awesome! More people need to hear your story.
- Jason</p>

<p>&#8220;I found this book online by accident and bought it at a time that coincidentally I was getting sick of working for someone else. The book is very motivational and a must read for anyone who wants to &#8220;break free&#8221;. The book offers a step by step approach to quiting your job and becoming financially independent.
The author of the book, Brian Armstrong, writes from his own experiences and shows how anyone can follow in his footsteps&#8230;making breaking free seem a lot more possible.
-by A. Lehrer, New York, NY</p>

<p>Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>I am loving the book for its inspiration as I have been contemplating quiting my job. I have more than sufficient $ to take some time off, so last Friday I went ahead and put in my two weeks. It&#8217;s a scary feeling to do this especially without a side business already up and running, but I can afford it. I know that taking some time off will help give me a level head and aid in my pursuit to find my passion.</p>

<p>Best,
Aaron V.</p>
