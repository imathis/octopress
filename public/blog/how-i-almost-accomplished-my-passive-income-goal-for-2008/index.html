  <div class="entry-content"><p>My one goal in 2008 (or new years resolution if you&#8217;d like) was to get to $2,000 per month in passive income.  There was hardly a day that went by in 2008 that I didn&#8217;t think about this goal actually.  I was that obsessed with it.</p>

<p>By the way, in case you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;$2,000 doesn&#8217;t sound like very much income per month&#8221;, keep in mind that this is PASSIVE income - income that comes in whether I work or not.  In other words, this income cannot come from any hourly or regular &#8220;job&#8221; type work.  It comes from things like real estate rental income, businesses you&#8217;ve setup that are running on autopilot, investment income like dividends, royalties from books or products being sold, etc.  I was also earning other income during this time from my existing business and consulting which DID require my time and wasn&#8217;t passive.</p>

<p>If you are curious why passive income is such a big goal of mine you can read <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-get-rich/">this</a> and <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-the-rich-think-differently-than-the-poor-and-middle-class/">this</a> for some background, but essentially it boils down to this: if you no longer have to trade your time for money you have truly broken free and can start to accomplish great things in life.</p>

<p><strong>Real Estate</strong></p>

<p>To be clear, my goal as originally <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-single-most-important-thing-to-do-in-2008/">written on this blog December 16th, 2007</a> was to get to $2,000 per month in passive income VIA REAL ESTATE specifically.  At that time I was convinced this was going to be my best path.</p>

<p>The year started out with a bang and in January I closed on 2 rental properties (the process to buy them had been in the works before this).  Things seemed to be going along fine - I had actually purchased 5 properties total in the last year and while some of them <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-a-good-real-estate-deal-turns-into-a-bad-one/">didn&#8217;t</a> <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/brian-goes-to-court-brings-home-the-bacon/">turn out</a> so well, <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-i-made-a-113-return-in-one-month-with-real-estate/">others did</a>.</p>

<p>After a court battle with an unscrupulous contractor and dealing with an incompetent/immoral mortgage broker, real estate was beginning to take it&#8217;s toll on me stress wise.  By this time it was already mid-year and I was not on track to get enough property to accomplish my goal by years end.  I was ready to keep pushing on, but at this time the mortgage market dried up (especially for self employed people like myself) which meant the deals kept getting better but I could not get financing to buy any of them.</p>

<p>It was time to re-evaluate my goal.  I had 3 properties rented out and cash flowing (with only about $250 per month in passive income after all expenses - I had hoped it would be more) but I was unable to buy more and I wasn&#8217;t close to accomplishing my goal.  It was time to &#8220;adjust&#8221; my goal to find another way.  Remember, if you want something bad enough there is always another way.</p>

<p><strong>The Blog</strong></p>

<p>Around this time I noticed that this blog had started to pull in some <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/blog-income-report-august-2008/">decent money</a>.  it wasn&#8217;t much yet but it had potential.  This got me excited enough to try some other monetization efforts, continue writing, and eventually <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-i-reached-2000-subscribers-on-this-blog/">break the 2,000 subscriber mark</a>.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve often said about blogging, pick something you love writing about because for the first year it will feel like nobody is reading it.  But if you can get through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841666?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwstartb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591841666">The Dip</a>, then you can wake up with a nice passive income business in a few years.</p>

<p>By the way, blogging isn&#8217;t as passive as some other forms, but I still consider it to be quite passive for two reasons: (1) I&#8217;d probably do it whether I got money from it or not and (2) when your blog becomes successful your compensation is not tied to the number of hours you put in like a traditional job.</p>

<p>Anyway, the blog began to contribute to my passive income slowly and steadily at this time until it was generating about $400 per month.  I was firing on two cylinders now - real estate and blogging - but I felt like I needed to add one more to accomplish my goal in time.  The year was running out!</p>

<p><strong>Launching The Tutoring Site</strong></p>

<p>Luckily, earlier in the year I had launched a <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/">passive income business as a test</a>.  This site matched tutors with students who needed help.</p>

<p>I had <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-evolution-of-a-business-model-never-stop-testing/">experimented</a> with all sorts of business models and finally got one with some potential.  It was starting to generate about $300 dollars per month, but at this point it was getting quite late in the year.</p>

<p><strong>So how close did I get?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I just finished putting together my financial statements for December 2008.  By the way, if you aren&#8217;t looking at your personal and business financial statements monthly you probably should be.  This is one of the best things I ever did to start accomplishing financial goals - a very wealthy mentor got me to start doing it and it&#8217;s really helped.  After all, how can you know if you&#8217;re accomplishing something unless you measure it?  <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-and-create-a-personal-financial-statement-each-month-in-5-minutes/">Here&#8217;s an easy way to do it yourself</a> if you don&#8217;t have an accountant (I do them myself too).</p>

<p>Anyway, here is how it broke down:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$250.00 - Real Estate Rental Income (after taking out principal, interest, taxes, insurance, HOA dues, etc - this is true cash flow)</p></li>
<li><p>$1,260.40 - this blog, StartBreakingFree.com from book sales, ads, affiliate commissions, etc</p></li>
<li><p>$129.20 - the tutoring site (after large advertising expenses for the month and a software glitch)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>TOTAL: $1,649.60</p>

<p>The real estate income was predictable.</p>

<p>The blog was a big surprise.  At the start of 2008 I would not have guessed this would have grown like it did.  I should also mention that during December there was higher than normal <a href="http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/">book sales</a> and affiliate commissions (although lower ad revenue due to decreased traffic during the holidays).  December was the blog&#8217;s most profitable month ever.</p>

<p>The tutoring site was the greatest disappointment for me.  I thought it would completely out-earn the blog, not the other way around.  There are two big reasons why the passive income it generated was low for December: (1) I had quite high advertising expenses to drive in new tutors that month, which was an investment in the business but hurt the cash flow and (2) it was suffering from a rather large bug in the software which caused much of the communication on the site to fail.  After getting complaints for several months from people using the site, I was FINALLY able to track down what was happening and it is now fixed.  (In case you are curious and a geek like me, the reverse DNS on my server was set incorrectly caused a large number of my outgoing emails to be marked as spam).</p>

<p>This was incredibly frustrating because I lost a bunch of paying customers and some people left in frustration.  But it is also exciting, because now that the bug is fixed I can see what this baby can really do!  I still have big hopes for it - and the number of users plus traffic to the site continue to grow quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Passive income is a funny thing because it requires a disproportionate amount of really hard work up front for very little compensation - and I felt like that was this year for me in some ways.  But I&#8217;ve laid the foundation for success and now that I&#8217;ve gotten the flywheel turning just a little bit, it won&#8217;t take much effort to have it REALLY humming in 2009.</p>

<p>The blog and tutoring site will continue to grow at an increasing pace with little additional effort on my part - they are great assets.  I&#8217;m still fond of real estate as an investment vehicle and will be open to buying more as the lending markets change.  I would especially like to invest in a partnership to buy an apartment complex (with the right investor) at some point in the future but financially that is a ways off.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m happy with getting 82% of the way toward my yearly goal ($1,649 out of $2,000).  I&#8217;ve read before that you&#8217;re goals should be ambitious enough that they really push you while at the same time being believable.  Put another way, you should have about a 50% chance of achieving it.  By that measure I&#8217;d say I was spot on.</p>

<p>And since I&#8217;m big on PUBLICLY writing my goals, and it worked so well in 2008, here is my goal for 2009: reach $5,000 per month in totally passive income.</p>

<p>I estimate that by the time I reach about $3,000 per month in passive income, I can probably stop doing all other types of earned income and I will effectively be retired at the age of 26 since I will no longer HAVE to work for money.  Of course, I still will be working on all sorts of interesting projects - that&#8217;s just my nature - but I&#8217;ll be able to choose them because I want to not because I need the money.  And that&#8217;s a very powerful place to be.</p>

<p><strong>Why not state your goals publicly as well?  What would you like to accomplish in 2009?  Try to make it specific, measurable, and include a deadline if possible - then leave a comment below!</strong></p>
