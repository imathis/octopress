    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/oh-snap-im-moving-to-south-america/">spent a year</a> in Buenos Aires, Argentina people sometimes ask me what my experience was and if I'd recommend it.</p>

<p>For example, here is a recent reader question and my response:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey Brian,</p></blockquote>

<p>Did you like being in Argentina? Is it as good as its cracked up to be and as cost-effective? How much does it cost (US dollars) to live really well down there?
R.D.</p>

<p><strong>My response:</strong></p>

<p><em>Hi R.D.,</em></p>

<p>_ _</p>

<p><em>I don't want to oversell it as I think some people have online.  Outside the city there is some serious poverty.  But inside there are some nice areas and certainly a different cool sort of European culture you can find with very nice people and good food.  I'd say you can live comfortably there on anywhere from $1000-$2000 a month, but of course this varies a lot based on your taste.  Things are not drastically cheaper there (some more, some less) but I'd say on average prices are about 25-50% cheaper than the U.S.  (of course you may not be earning as many U.S. dollars while you are down there).</em></p>

<p><em>Overall I'm very glad I did it, and I think it's one of those life experiences that has helped me grow as a person.  But don't buy into the tales of travel as some mystical experience.  It is a city just like anywhere else, with good people and bad people.  Take it for what it's worth and enjoy it as a fun experience either with a partner or as a process of self discovery on your own.</em></p>

<p><em>Compared to other places I've traveled in the world, BA is definitely up there in the top 3.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you,
Brian Armstrong</em></p>

<p>====================================</p>

<p><strong>Further Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>One surprising result after traveling abroad is that I definitely developed a much bigger appreciation of the U.S.</p>

<p>People tend to romanticize foreign countries by saying the people there appreciate the important things in life, or are happier with what they have, or generally lead simpler lives that aren't based on rushing around, checking your email 20 times a day, and being so career oriented.</p>

<p>It can be nice to experience this as a temporary reprieve from a busy life, but for locals who actually live abroad this romanticized idea quickly evaporates.  Greater corruption exists (I witnessed both bribing of police and city inspectors while in Buenos Aires), taxes are higher (creating a large grey market), and there is plenty of counterfeit money and petty theft.  For people with fewer opportunities in life, crime is an attractive option.</p>

<p>The U.S. has many flaws, but strictly in terms of economic opportunity I haven't seen a better place to live yet.  For me at least this is a trump card, although clearly everyone has difference priorities.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

    <updated>2010-02-03T21:57:24-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://brianarmstrong.org/blog/im-moving-to-the-san-francisco-bay-area</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quick post to let you know I've decided to move from <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/oh-snap-im-moving-to-south-america/">Buenos Aires</a> back to the bay area (where I grew up).  I'll be moving in a few days.  I was planning to keep traveling for a while but a great opportunity came up to work on a new startup.</p>

<p>While I was back in the bay area for Christmas I randomly emailed some folks who had posted on Hacker News about their startup.  I went and met them for coffee and we ended up meeting for the next 6 hours!  We talked business and strategy, geeked out on programming skills, and talked about the future.  They liked my background in startups  and what they needed in a programmer was a good match with my skills.  Their idea is solid and has some big potential.  A week later they made me an offer to come join them and I decided to accept.</p>

<p>They are 3 very smart guys who just got funding for their idea, and it is a <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">y-combinator company</a>, something I've always wanted to be a part of.  The startup is still in stealth mode so I won't post a link to the site yet (I will when we launch).  Their investors are high profile and the sort of people I want to meet.  The bay area is also the center of everything in the technology startup world right now, and I'd love to dive into that scene head first.  Part of me was reluctant to give up traveling the world for a bit, and technically it is a "real job" which conflicts with the message of this site :)  But it is a startup and my own projects will keep running on the side (luckily they run almost entirely on their own at this point - both businesses and investment property) and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get involved in this group.</p>

<p>In short, I can't wait to get to the bay area.  Vagabonding has been fun for a bit, and Buenos Aires is a magical city that I won't soon forget, but I can't wait to see what opportunities lie in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Until next time, keep breaking free!

    <link href="http://brianarmstrong.org/blog/total-expenses-living-in-buenos-aires-last-month-1018/"/>
    <updated>2009-07-09T05:37:50-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://brianarmstrong.org/blog/total-expenses-living-in-buenos-aires-last-month-1018</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished doing my <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-and-create-a-personal-financial-statement-each-month-in-5-minutes/">financial statements</a> for last month, and was pretty happy when I noticed that it only cost a total of $1,018 USD for me to live and work in Buenos Aires last month!  That's really cheap, certainly much cheaper than living in the U.S.</p>

<p>This proves the point I <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/oh-snap-im-moving-to-south-america/">wrote about a while back</a>, which is that it really isn't that expensive to travel the world if you do it right.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>How can you afford to travel the world?</strong>
It’s not that expensive.  Most people think of world travel like a vacation – and that’s not the right way to think about it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vacations are expensive because you still have all your expenses back home (mortgage/rent, car payment, gym, cell phone, etc) to make in ADDITION to the new expenses you just rang up (plane ticket, hotels, etc). It’s basically like living in two cities at once.</p>

<p>But I’m not taking a VACATION to South America – I’m actually MOVING there. This means I will not be paying any living expenses in the U.S., I will be selling my car, and will be canceling or putting on hold all other expenses (phone, gym, etc).</p>

<p>I won’t be staying in hotels there or paying tourist prices. I will be renting an apartment (probably month to month). The plane ticket to get there isn’t cheap (about $1,000) but once there most travel around South America can be done on buses or trains (or even short plane trips city to city) very inexpensively.</p>

<p>So what did I actually spend my money on?  Here's the breakdown...</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-51.png" alt="Monthly Expenses Living In Buenos Aires June 2009" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>$450 - renting this <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/video-of-my-apartment-in-buenos-aires/">room</a></p></li>
<li><p>$88 - my health insurance from the U.S.</p></li>
<li><p>$480 - everything else (cash expenses) mostly food</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Normally I'd break down expenses further by looking at credit card statements, but people don't really use credit cards much in Buenos Aires so I don't have a good record of it.  I pay for everything with cash so it's all lumped into that $480.  Probably most of it is food and drinks though.</p>

<p>For that amount you can live pretty nicely here...I think I ate out for dinner almost every night in June (might have cooked dinner at home once) and my room is in probably the nicest neighborhood in Buenos Aires.  But on the other hand, it's not like I had a <a href="http://www.ba4uapartments.com.ar/en/recoleta.html">penthouse</a> with a private pool or did any lavish shopping or anything like that (although those are pretty reasonably priced too).</p>

<p>So anyway, if you have a business that let's you be mobile while working, "moving" to Buenos Aires can be a great way to save some money and have an adventure in the process.</p>

    <link href="http://brianarmstrong.org/blog/oh-snap-im-moving-to-south-america/"/>
    <updated>2009-01-20T02:32:52-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://brianarmstrong.org/blog/oh-snap-im-moving-to-south-america</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest things about working for yourself is the mobility.</p>

<p>Freedom comes in a lot of forms:  Free time for doing things you really enjoy.  Freedom to make your own decisions without a boss.  And freedom to travel at will.  It's great to know that I don't have to ask people for time off or count sick days and I need to start taking advantage of this more.</p>

<p>That's why I've been spending the last year or so transitioning my business and income to <a href="http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-i-almost-accomplished-my-passive-income-goal-for-2008/">be more passive</a> and more online because I've had this goal in mind for a long time: I'd like to travel the world and earning money doing it!</p>

<p>The idea of traveling around the world on a shoe-string budget picking up odd jobs and staying on couches doesn't really appeal to me.  What DOES appeal to me is having a business that will continue to grow and thrive as I travel the world.  The internet has made this possible.</p>

<p><strong>What city are you going to?</strong>
I'm going to Buenos Aires Argentina first just because I've heard it's amazing.  I'll probably just drop into a hostel there and figure it out from there.  I eventually hope to see a bunch of places around Argentina, but I'm deliberately leaving it unplanned.  I don't want to have the deadline looming of a pre-purchased flight or anything like that.  I want to just explore as I go.</p>

<p><strong>When are you going?</strong>
Probably around early May after attending a friend's wedding in the states.</p>

<p><strong>Why Buenos Aires?</strong>
I first heard about this place from <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferriss</a> (this trip is very Tim Ferriss-esque overall) and have since read a great deal about it.  Here are a few things I like about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's called the Paris of South America - gorgeous city, cafes, clubs, shops, etc</p></li>
<li><p>Extremely safe and welcoming of foreigners</p></li>
<li><p>Still inexpensive</p></li>
<li><p>Beautiful women</p></li>
<li><p>Fast and widely available internet</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Basically the only bad thing I can find about it is that people are allowed to smoke in bars and clubs there.</p>

<p>I plan to go to a bunch of other places after Bueones Aires as well.</p>

<p><strong>How can you afford to travel the world?</strong>
It's not that expensive.  Most people think of world travel like a vacation - and that's not the right way to think about it.</p>

<p>Vacations are expensive because you still have all your expenses back home (mortgage/rent, car payment, gym, cell phone, etc) to make in ADDITION to the new expenses you just rang up (plane ticket, hotels, etc).  It's basically like living in two cities at once.</p>

<p>But I'm not taking a VACATION to South America - I'm actually MOVING there.  This means I will not be paying any living expenses in the U.S., I will be selling my car, and will be canceling or putting on hold all other expenses (phone, gym, etc).</p>

<p>I won't be staying in hotels there or paying tourist prices.  I will be renting an apartment (probably month to month).  The plane ticket to get there isn't cheap (about $1,000) but once there most travel around South America can be done on buses or trains (or even short plane trips city to city) very inexpensively.</p>

<p><strong>How (in)expensive is it to live there? </strong>
Well, I'm told you can rent a fully furnished apartment with AC and internet included for around $400/month US which is just ridiculous.  There is an elaborate subway and bus system in Beunos Aires (which costs I think 25 cents to ride?) so you don't need a car.  And the best steak dinner you've ever had in your life is about $5.</p>

<p>And that is living a rather nice lifestyle.  You can also stay in shared Hostels for about $7 per night and eat more modest meals.  This would bring your total living expenses in Buenos Aires down to about $15 per day or $450 per month if you really wanted to.</p>

<p>In short, I actually plan to be spending MUCH LESS than I currently do to live in the U.S.  (Perhaps with the plane ticket the first month might about break even with U.S. expenses.)</p>

<p><strong>What are you going to bring with you?</strong>
As little as possible.  Basically a backpack a few clothes, my laptop, and a camera.  <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/07/11/how-to-travel-the-world-with-10-pounds-or-less-plus-how-to-negotiate-convertibles-and-luxury-treehouses/">This post</a> helped me out a lot and a number of things I've read have convinced of the wisdom of traveling light.  I still need to get a good backpack.</p>

<p><strong>What will you do with all your stuff?</strong>
Sell it or give it away on Craigslist.com most likely, aside from a few boxes my current roommate might let me keep in the closet.  If you live in Houston and want a pet tarantula send me an email.  I have two!</p>

<p><strong>How will you be making money?</strong>
The same way I make money in Houston.  I will have to give my properties to a management company most likely (which will reduce the cash flow).  But otherwise it won't change much.</p>

<p><strong>Ever heard of geo-arbitrage?</strong>
Yes.  For those who don't know, one awesome thing about making money on the internet is what's sometimes referred to as "geo-arbitrage".  For the first time in history, the internet has allowed people to not have to reside in the same city where they earn a living.  That means you can EARN money in dollars or euros and SPEND it in a currency that offers a good exchange rate (like Argentine pesos) - in effect, instantly increasing the value of your money.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you going with?</strong>
No one!  I'm going by myself.  This will be a good process of self discovery and force me to meet new people I'm sure.  I've done trips in the past with groups and it's hard to really get the feel for a culture since you just stay together all the time (and ultimately end up getting on each others nerves a bit by the end).</p>

<p>If you happen to be in the same city when I am though I'm always up for meeting.  Drop me a line.</p>

<p>Actually, a big shout out is owed to <a href="http://www.manuelzeh.de/">Manuel Zeh</a> - a friend who is currently traveling the world (and in Honduras?) who has been traveling for years and gave me a ton of tips.  Hopefully our paths will cross somewhere down there!</p>

<p><strong>Won't you get bored and lonely?</strong>
Well, honestly I have no idea.  Maybe.  That's why I'm leaving it unplanned.  I might stay there for a year and come back, or eventually head to another continent, or travel indefinitely, or be back in a month.</p>

<p>But I doubt I'll get bored or lonely.  After all, it's not like I'll be visiting museums or laying on a beach.  I'm going to be LIVING there.  So I'll still be working a lot on my business, playing sports, joining clubs, meeting other entrepreneurs, partying, etc.  I'll be doing many of the things I do in Houston and hopefully lots more.  I plan on taking up a few new hobbies.  Also, I can be <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/how-to-make-a-bunch-of-new-friends-in-any-new-city.html">pretty outgoing</a> when I need to be.</p>

<p>I don't have plans to stay in Houston long term, so I figure world travel will be a good way to try a bunch of new cities and ultimately decide where I might want to live.</p>

<p><strong>How is your Spanish?</strong>
Hablo un poco espanol.  Necesito practicar y creo que Buenos Aires es un lugar perfecto!</p>

<p><strong>Can you send a postcard?</strong>
I'll be blogging my way throughout the journey (and the preparation leading up to it - the trip isn't until May this year) with lots of photos so stay tuned.  As always, I'd love to hear your suggestions or tips if you've had a similar adventure or know the area well.</p>

<p>I think this will be an excellent experiment in truly Breaking Free, and I hope to share as much of it as I can with you!</p>
