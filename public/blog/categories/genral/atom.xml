    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We recently opened a couple of API endpoints at <a href="http://gogobot.com">Gogobot</a> to the public.</p>

<p>I was looking for a way to generate API documentation in a good looking way, one that will appeal to my fellow developers.</p>

<p>After a little while search with Google, I thought I had it nailed with a Twitter Bootstrap theme, but the way I had to generate the documentation was too manual, I had to edit lots of files and I really didn't find it "easy".</p>

<p>So, I was looking around some more, and I finally found a really easy way to generate API documentation here: <a href="http://apidocjs.com/">apidocjs.com</a></p>

<p>It really nailed everything I was looking for:</p>

<ol>
<li>Super easy customizable template.</li>
<li>Intuitive documentation</li>
<li>Document versioning</li>
<li>Version compare</li>
</ol>


<p>Everything is super easy and at your fingertips.</p>

<p>One thing that I have to say badly about it, is that it's using an old deprecated Markdown parser, but I am already working to fix it and post a Pull Request for it (Gotta love open source)</p>
