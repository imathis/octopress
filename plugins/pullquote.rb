# Based on the semantic pullquote technique by Maykel Loomans at http://miekd.com/articles/pull-quotes-with-html5-and-css/
#
# Outputs a span with a data-pullquote attribute set from the marked pullquote. Example:
#
#   {% pullquote %} 
#     When writing longform posts, I find it helpful to include pullquotes, which help those scanning a post discern whether or not a post is helpful.
#     It is important to note, {" pullquotes are merely visual in presentation and should not appear twice in the text. "} That is why it is prefered
#     to use a CSS only technique for styling pullquotes.
#   {% endpullquote %}
#   ...will output...
#   <p>
#     <span data-pullquote="pullquotes are merely visual in presentation and should not appear twice in the text.">

#  Strand's modification adds the ability to call this plugin with {% pullquote left %} which duplicates the current behavior of the pullquote plugin, with a left float and appropriate margins.
#  Note: this version of the plugin now creates pullquotes with the class of pullquote-right by default
