The category generator builds category specific archive pages for each category in your blog posts.
The archive pages use the category layout (included with Octopress). In the `_config.yml` you may change
the directory for the category archives if you like and the title for the category pages.

    category_dir: blog/categories
    category_title_prefix: "Category: "

If you visit a category archive for 'open source' the url would be `/blog/categories/open-source/` and the title would be `Category: Open Source`.

This plugin was originally developed by [Dave Perrett](http://brandontilley.com/2011/01/31/gist-tag-for-jekyll.html) but it has been updated and improved for Octopress.
