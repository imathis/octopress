With the `backtick_codeblock` filter you can use Github's lovely back tick syntax highlighting blocks.
Simply start a line with three back ticks followed by a space and the language you're using. Tab in four spaces
for your code snippets, and then finish your code block with three more back ticks.

**Note: Back tick code blocks are only supported in HTML and Markdown. With the Textile markup language, use the [codeblocks](/docs/plugins/codeblock/) instead.**

#### Syntax

{% codeblock %}
``` language
    code snippet
```
{% endcodeblock %}

#### Example

{% codeblock %}
``` ruby
    class Fixnum
      def prime?
        ('1' * self) !~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
      end
    end
```
{% endcodeblock %}

``` ruby
    class Fixnum
      def prime?
        ('1' * self) !~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
      end
    end
```

This is a nice, lightweight way to add a highlighted code snippet. For features like titles and links you'll want to look
at the [codeblock](/docs/plugins/codeblock/) or [include_code](/docs/plugins/include-code/) liquid tags.
