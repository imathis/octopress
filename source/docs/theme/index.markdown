For now Octopress ships with a single theme in the `.themes` directory. When you install the Octopress theme, HTML and Javascripts are copied into `/source` and Sass stylesheets are copied into `/sass`.
You are free to make any changes you like, but I've set up a few patterns to make it easy to customize and keep your site up to date with the latest Octopress releases.

I've broken this up into two sections.

1. [Customizing the Template](/docs/theme/template/) - *Learn how to change the HEAD, sidebar, header, navigation & footer*
2. [Changing Styles](/docs/theme/styles) - *Learn how to change the color scheme, layout, and override styles*

Also see [Updating Your Blog &raquo;](/docs/updating)
