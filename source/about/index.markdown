My name is Avi Tzurel. Iâ€™m a professional web developer from Israel. 

I spend most of my day developing both web products and RIA applications, as well as imparting my experience onto others. I speak, teach and write about my passions, and develop applications according to what I preach.

I contribute regularly to open source projects on Github and on other open source communities, you can find me on StackOverflow, facebook, twitter and other social networks under the Alias (KensoDev).
