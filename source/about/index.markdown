Hi. I’m Mark.
{% img right /images/mark201x240.png 201 240 your host %}

I was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in Decatur, Illinois. I have a Bachelor’s Degree from Illinois State University in Applied Computer Science, and I work as a Software Architect in Manhattan Kansas. Previously I have lived and worked in Illinois, Indiana, Washington, and South Carolina.

I am married as a result of using eHarmony. Sibylle and I are exploring the world as partners, lovers, companions, best friends, and now husband and wife. We are finding that two lives shared are truly greater than the sum of the individuals involved.

I have been writing online since 1999, and have had this site since 1996. I also have a seldom updated WordPress.com site, zanshin.wordpress.com, and a new Tumblr site, tumblr.zanshin.com. Sibylle and I share a WordPress.com site, called sibylleandmark.wordpress.com. I also have various subdomains of zanshin.net including cello.zanshin.net, where I write about learning to play the cello.

I have:

* a second degree (nidan) black belt in karate-do,
* 2 cats, two 7-foot concert grand pianos, an electric piano, a cello, and 9 or 10 computers in my home, and
* a younger brother.

I know how to:

* sail a boat,
* iron a shirt, and
* make a mean pot of chili.

I am:

* fascinated by the processes that make things work,
* able to juggle, and
* learning to play the violoncello.

I want:

* to travel around the world,
* to live without pleasing anyone but myself, and
* live to see the tricentennial .

I am interested in, and pursue as hobbies: cooking, travel, computers, software, martial arts, photography, and movies. I am increasingly fascinated by processes and language, and someday I’d like to study semiotics.

Words to Live By
