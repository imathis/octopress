I was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in Decatur, Illinois. I have a Bachelor’s Degree from Illinois State University in Applied Computer Science, and I work as the Integration Services Coordinator for the [Office of Mediated Education](http://www.ksu.edu/ome "Office of Mediated Education") at [Kansas State University](http://www.ksu.edu "Kansas State University") in Manhattan Kansas. Previously I have lived and worked in Illinois, Indiana, Washington, and South Carolina.

I am married as a result of using eHarmony. [Sibylle](http://sibyllekuder.com "Elfenbein Klaviermusik") and I are exploring the world as partners, lovers, companions, best friends, and now husband and wife. We are finding that two lives shared are truly greater than the sum of the individuals involved.

I have been writing online since 1999, and have had this site since 1996. Sibylle and I share a WordPress.com site, called [Sibylle and Mark](http://sibylleandmark.wordpress.com "Sibylle and Mark"). [Solfège](http://cello.zanshin.net "solfege") is my blog about learning to play the violoncello. 

I have:

* a second degree (nidan) black belt in _karate-do_,
* 2 cats, two 7-foot concert grand pianos, an electric piano, a cello, and 9 or 10 computers in my home, and
* a younger brother.

I know how to:

* sail a boat,
* iron a shirt, and
* make a mean pot of chili.

I am:

* fascinated by the processes that make things work,
* able to juggle, and
* learning to play the violoncello.

I want:

* to travel around the world,
* to live without pleasing anyone but myself, and
* live to see the tricentennial .

I am interested in, and pursue as hobbies: cooking, travel, computers, software, martial arts, photography, and movies. I am increasingly fascinated by processes and language, and someday I’d like to study semiotics.

Words to Live By
