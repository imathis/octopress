A [Flickr/Googlemaps/Twitter mashup](http://www.icklepickles.org/lejog/) to follow progress of charity cycle ride.

The "site" is a single page app entirely written in client javascript and jQuery.

View the [source code](https://github.com/allegromanontroppo/IcklePickles--trip-tracker).

The photos from the Flickr set are displayed on the left, the map is in the middle and the IcklePickles's latest tweets are down the right.
