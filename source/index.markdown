## Hi, I'm a software engineer and tech entrepreneur living in San Francisco, California.  This is my personal website and blog.

<br/>
### Me At A Glance:
* Technical Project Manager at <a href="http://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb.com</a>
* Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.universitytutor.com" target="_blank">UniversityTutor.com</a>
* Author of [Breaking Free](/breaking-free)
* Lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina for a year
* Studied computer science (MCS) and economics (BA) at Rice University in Houston, TX

I love <a href="/projects">building new things with technology</a> and working with startups.  My strength is in engineering web and mobile apps and bringing new product ideas to market.

Here are some (tiny) pages on [talks](/talks) and [press](/press).  Hopefully those will grow over time!
