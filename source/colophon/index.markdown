Zanshin.net is a statically generated site, created using the [Octopress](http://octopress.org "Octopress 2.0") framework, which is a wrapper of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki "Jekyll"). After several years of happily producing my thoughts via [WordPress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress") I decided I wanted to return to a more hands-on, roll your sleeves up and get dirty, approach. For me Octopress sits neatly in between the valet-parking-fresh-mints-on-your-pillow WordPress experience and the sleeping-under-pine-boughs-fending-off-bear-attacks Jekyll experience. Octopress is the rental-cabin-in-the-mountains-with-hot-running-water experience.

The pages are all HTML 5, and the style sheets are a mixture of SASS-generated CSS and my own clunky attempts at design. Commenting is provided through [Disqus](http://disqus.com/ "Disqus"), site statistics are collected by [Mint](http://haveamint.com "Mint"), and the whole shebang is hosted on a shared IP server at [Bluehost](http://bluehost.com "Bluehost.com").

The Octopress backend (if you can call it a backend) resides on my late 2009 MacBookPro and is versioned through Git. All editing is done via [Textmate](http://macromates.com/ "Textmate"), with occasional forays into [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim") just to be nerdy.
