I am a website and Windows software developer. Previously I worked with Borland C++ solidly for six years building Windows applications and services but these days I create websites in [asp.net](http://www.asp.net/),  [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and JavaScript.

I love to create great websites and applications with as little excess baggage as possible.

Despite having thirteen years of professional development of experience I'm more enthused than ever about development. I'm thrilled to be able program in a time of dynamic languages such a Ruby or Python. Having spent my entire career in the compiled languages world it's wonderful to be able to just create complex objects out of thin air.

Recently I've really taken to Javascript too; having properly understood what it's capable of and how it truly works. Like many this has been off the back of using jQuery for DOM manipulation. Through this I've also become greatly excited about the possibilities of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). It would have been perfect for the work I did at Videonetworks, blasting IO back and forth.

My pet projects this past year have been in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), Javascript and a reasonable dabble with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). I realise though that I have got to get a handle on testing. It's the next thing on my to-do list.

Generally speaking, I think we're at a really exciting time where we can do great things natively in the browser with HTML5 and CSS3 and use progressive enhancement and shims to give retro browsers an acceptable experience at the same time.

Time was being on the Borland mailing list was the extent of being part of the global dev community. Now though through Twitter, [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and Podcasts it's terrific to fell part of the scene and keep up-to-date with the scene.

I live with my wife and daughter in Sussex.
