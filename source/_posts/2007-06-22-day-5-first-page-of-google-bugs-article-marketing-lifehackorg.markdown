[![First Page of Google Results](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-111-150x150.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-111.gif)This is day 5 of my 30 day [challenge](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/16/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/) to build build traffic to this blog.

As a side note, I achieved two top ten rankings on Google!  I am #8 (first page) for both keywords "start home business" and "start home based business".  This is huge, and is the result of some SEO work that I paid a guy to do about a month ago.  I found him on [eLance.com](http://www.elance.com), and from what I understand he accomplished this mostly through paid links.

I've been getting about 800-1000 visits per day the last few days, and subscribers are up to 792 after taking a major dip due to my switch to FeedBlitz and some technical problems.

Here are the three tasks I accomplished today:

1. Spent a number of hours fixing bugs on the website.  There was a bug in the email newsletter that went out.  My apologies for that, I'm working to fix it.  There was also a bug with the contact form on this page now showing up which I was finally able to resolve.  These are not the sort of traffic building activities I want to be spending my time on, but it's important to have a working website before sending more people to look at it.



2. Since most of my traffic so far has come from being a contributing editor on lifehack.org, I decided to see what other contributing editor positions I could get at other blogs.  The more traffic the better, so I went to Technorati's [top 100 blogs](http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/) page and looked for related blogs.  I sent in requests to lifehacker.com (different than lifehack.org, but much more traffic), http://searchengineland.com, and http://www.problogger.net/.

3. I wrote another article for LifeHack.org which will be posted soon.  You can see the last article I wrote for them [here](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/power-napping-how-to-fall-asleep-anywhere.html).  It generated more comments than any other article I've seen recently.
