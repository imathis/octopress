All week long, as we have waited for the delivery of our washing machine, Sibylle and I have kidded about sitting down in the basement watching it run.  You know, a pair of lawn chairs, a lamp, maybe a drink with an umbrella.  Entertainment.  Color television.

The delivery has been made, and the first load is now being washed as this is being typed.  I'm sitting in the basement, half watching the new color tele... er, washer do it's thing.

Really.
