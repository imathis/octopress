On both of our flights today the seat tray tables had embedded ads.  When you unfolded them for use the tray table top had a full-color ad that covered the entire surface.  Maybe this is just a US Air innovation, maybe everyone is doing it now; I fly so infrequently that I am not up on the current trends.  My first thought when I saw the ads was that planes are going to be the next stadiums.  Just as we now have stadiums named for corporations or their products, we'll soon have flights named for or sponsored by corporations.
