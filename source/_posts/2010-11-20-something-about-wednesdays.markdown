I thought I was imagining things.  

It seemed like on Wednesdays more tutors became paying customers on [UniversityTutor](http://www.universitytutor.com).

So I ran a quick query and it turns out it's true.

So....tutors are more than twice as likely to start paying on a Wednesday vs a Saturday?

Seems like such a big difference I hardly believe it.  But there it is.

**Any idea why this might be?  Would love to hear your theory in the comments below :)**

Btw, here is the Ruby code I used to get the data.  The graph is created in Keynote.
