[![Breaking Free Appeared on Amazon.com Today](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/amazonbooks1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/amazonbooks1.png)This is day 28 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new visitors to this website.  I also want to demonstrate that [starting a blog can be a profitable and inexpensive business to start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

My three tasks for the day are...



### 1. Updated Information On Amazon.com



My [book on how to start a home based business](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/) finally appeared on [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Free-Perfect-Business-Opportunity/dp/1430307870/ref=sr_1_1/104-9160704-8211906?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1184702611&sr=8-1) today.

The images didn't show up however, and the formatting of the text could use some work, so I spent some time correcting it.  The text hasn't updated yet, but the new images are there.





### 2. I Created a "Listmania" on Amazon.com



[Listmania](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=cm_lm_create_help/104-9160704-8211906?ie=UTF8&nodeId=14279651) lists on Amazon represent a marketing opportunity (I got this idea from Yanik Silver by the way).  I titled the one I created "[How to start a business](http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R26UGMUBHP2IEF/ref=cm_lm_pthnk_view/104-9160704-8211906?ie=UTF8&lm%5Fbb=)", and it not only includes my book, but many other [popular business books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/3/ref=pd_ts_b_nav/104-9160704-8211906?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=left-1&pf_rd_r=0T397NFGPWBX86TMRFAS&pf_rd_t=2101&pf_rd_p=221591101&pf_rd_i=51546011) that are out right now.

If I add the most popular business books to my list, that means I get to capitalize on the tons of traffic they are getting because my listmania shows up on each of their pages.  I think my listmania list to gain some popularity though before it will start showing up.  Amazon seems like it is only showing the top three for now, but I think the idea is solid even if it doesn't work right away.



### 3. Changed the Sub-title of the book on Amazon



Notice that I also changed the sub-title of the book from "Fire Your Boss, Toss Your Alarm Clock, and Double Your Income With An Easy Transition Into Self-Employment" to "How To Work At Home With The Perfect Small Business Opportunity" for the Amazon copy.

Why did I do this?  Keywords.

People search Amazon just like they search Google, and based on the keyword research very few people search for terms like "breaking free", "fire your boss", or "self-employment".

I want my book to come up for the most popular searches on Amazon, so I put some popular keywords in the sub-title such as "work at home", "small business", and "business opportunity".
