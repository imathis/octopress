Check out this question from a Breaking Free reader...


> Hey Brian,

I have been thinking about opening a coffee shop, not long actually probably for this past month, Im 21 years old and currently part of an internship. I have a lot of time to plan, and research, but I cant seem to grasp what exactly I need to do. The obvious would be taking a basic course in business, however, in the meantime… Do you have any suggestions on what I should start learning, if I am someday to own a coffee lounge? Books? Sites for people starting coffee shops? Anything you post is HIGHLY appreciated thanks…

Hi Brimo,

I have zero experience starting coffee shops, but I can tell you what I’d do if I wanted to learn how: find half a dozen local coffee shops that seem to be doing really well, and see if you can get a meeting with the owner.

Most business owners are willing to help if you approach it as a younger person who is eager to learn. Just tell them you are an aspiring entrepreneur and have no idea what you are doing, but want to see if you could get 10 minutes of their time and some advice. They’ll talk your ear off with all the challenges they’ve faced, some may try to talk you out of it, but it will all be valuable. If you happen to connect especially well with one of them, try to follow up with them on a regular basis and get them as as mentor.

Remember: the best way to be successful is to find someone who has already done it and do what they’re doing. Only after you have really mastered what they're doing is it time to innovate - not in the beginning.

Also, be careful not to get advice from a coffee shop owner who is also doing it for the first time, almost bankrupt, or barely getting by. Obviously this is a delicate issue and you can’t ask them outright for their financial statements, so you’ll have to use your best judgment. Advice from a failing coffee shop owner could actually be worse than no advice at all. Find the people who have been doing it a long time, own multiple shops, and are actually successful at it.

At least that's how I'd go about it - do any readers have experience opening coffee shops? Maybe you can leave your advice for Brimo in the comments.

Good luck, and keep breaking free!
