Great Googly Moogly!

Yesterday I put up a short posting about wistful thinking, wondering what it would be like to have more than a handful of visitors to my site in a day (or week, or month).  Today I know what that feels like thanks to the generosity and kindness of one man.

This morning, as usual, I clicked refresh on the Mint tab to see what my total was for yesterday.  I nearly fell off my chair when the number was nearly a hundred visits higher than normal.  I <em>did </em>fall off my chair when I realized those visits had all happened between 10 pm and midnight.  And I was beside myself when I saw that today's visits, hour by hour, are greater than I normally get in 24 hours.

Holy mackerel.

Thank you <a href="http://shawnblanc.net" title="Shawn Blanc">Mr. Blanc</a>.  Your random act of kindness has pasted a smile on my face that won't soon go away.  <em>Domo arigato gozaimasu. </em>
