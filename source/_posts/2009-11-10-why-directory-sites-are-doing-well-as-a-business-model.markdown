I met up with a few entrepreneurs from Dublin, Ireland this week in Buenos Aires.  They have a web business based around the [voiceover](http://www.piehole.ie/JessicaFreed) industry.  If you don't know, the voiceover industry is a bit like acting or modeling in that people typically have agents - except they get hired to record their voice for commercials and things like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVxP33iQ6KM).

You can see a sample of one of their pages [here](http://www.piehole.ie/JessicaFreed).

By the way, their logo looks a bit strange, but apparently that is the tonsils on the back of someone's mouth (their piehole).

Really, it's a similar business model to UniversityTutor.com or Haystack.com which I've talked about recently.  Simply put, you get a bunch of listings from some sort of service provider, try to get traffic from people who need to find them, and then you charge the service provider a subscription to get work through your site.

The challenge is establishing your site as the dominant one in that niche by getting lots of traffic and good search engine rankings, but once you do it's difficult for a new comer to overtake you.  There are high barriers to entry in that sense.

These types of sites aren't very complex technologically, but I think they do serve an important purpose: **they are making markets more efficient by eliminating agents.**

Seth Godin talked about [this idea](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/03/where-have-all-the-agents-gone.html) recently.  Travel agents have largely disappeared because people can buy plane tickets online now.  Stock brokers are disappearing because people can do their own trades online.  Sure, they will continue to exist for a long time in niche businesses where they still provide a valuable service, but they will be nowhere near as common as they used to be.

What other types of agents are going to disappear next?  Real estate agents quite possibly.  Voice over agents.  Tutoring "agents" (also known as tutoring companies - but it's really the same thing).  The web will be disruptive (in a good way) to a large number of industries.  The service agents provide (helping you find quality among a large number of choices) can increasingly be done with websites.

Is this a bad thing?  Well, if you are one of these agents then from your perspective yes.  But for society as a whole this is absolutely a good thing to "eliminate the middle man" and make markets more efficient.  When a 20% commission isn't being paid to an agent, the service provider can earn more and the buyer can pay less (a double win).  And eventually the agent is redistributed to a more productive part of the labor market.  It sounds cold to talk about people's jobs like that, but it's absolutely a net win for society.  Change is inevitable.

**What do you think of directory sites as a business model?  What will be the next "middleman" to go the way of the travel agent?**

Until next time, keep breaking free!
