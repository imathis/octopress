The United States is being forced to grow up in as a result of efforts to improve border security. Starting <em>tomorrow</em> US citizens returning to the country from Mexico and Canada will be required to show a passport. A driver's license or birth certificate will no longer be accepted. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/us/22passport.html?em&amp;ex=1169614800&amp;en=5152aac36a30067c&amp;ei=5087%0A" title="Tighter Passport Controls">tighter passport controls</a> are only the first step. Tomorrow's change is only for air passengers. As soon as 2008 the requirement maybe expended to include ground travel between the US and it's neighbors.

The longest "open" border in the world just closed.
