Michele and I are going to see <a href="http://eddieizzard.com/home.izz" target="_blank">Eddie Izzard</a> in October at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago. We have been avid fans of his comedy since Michele "discovered" him on HBO a few years ago. His razor sharp wit, combined with great delivery and mime, makes him the best comedian touring today. No one else is doing Sean Connery as Noah in a speed boat, shooting across the water for photos in the Bible. No one else could.

If he is coming to your town do yourself a favor and get tickets to go see him.
