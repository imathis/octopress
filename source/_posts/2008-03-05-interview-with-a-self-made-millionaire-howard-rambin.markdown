Today we have another Interview with a Self-Made Millionaire.

My guest is Howard Rambin, who is the CEO and co-founder of the
largest commercial real estate firm in Houston, TX, Moody Rambin
Interests.

Howard has literally bought and sold hundred of properties worth
many millions of dollars, and he has some great advice for people
just getting started in their own business.

In this interview, Howard shares some priceless information,
including:

* How his net worth went from $27 million to zero in one year,
how he built it all back and more, and what he learned from the
experience.

* The "Mother Metaphor", a simple philosophy his company uses to
build better relationships with their customers.

* How to use leverage to build wealth, whether it's in real
estate or not.

* How he analyzes every deal that comes across his desk and
decides what to invest in.

* Why mentors are the most important tools to learning, and how
he personally found successful people to help him throughout his
career. (He also shares his personal email and phone number for
anyone who'd like to ask his advice at the end.)

* Why diversification is the key to protecting your financial
fortress, and some upcoming trends you should watch for
investment opportunities.
