Sibylle and I are buying a house. What's more, it is still under construction so we get to have some input into its creation and shaping. This is exciting, thrilling, stressful, joyous, exhausting, and altogether splendid. We've started writing about the whole process over on <a title="Our Journey" href="http://sibylleandmark.wordpress.com" target="_blank">our WordPress.com</a> site.
