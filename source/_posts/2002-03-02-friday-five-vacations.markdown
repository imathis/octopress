Something new. Finally. I discovered a site called <a href="http://fridayfive.org" target="_blank">fridayFive</a>. The concept is simple... they ask five questions and you answer. So here goes.

1. What's your favorite vacation spot?
Anywhere I can go with my Sweetie-Pie. =) With her by my side everyplace is a vacation.

2. Where do you consider to be the biggest hell-hole on earth?
What makes a hell-hole?

3. What would be your dream vacation?
Time spent at home with no place to go, no one bothering us, and no time limits.

4. If you could go on a road-trip with anyone, who would it be and why?
My Sweetie-Pie. We have moved across country three times in 5 years and are very good together in a confined space.

5. What are your plans for this weekend?
Cooking, cooking and more cooking. Zuppa tuscana soup Saturday, and jumbalaya Sunday.
