The email subscriptions for Breaking Free are handled by FeedBurner, and I've always wished they would provide an option to send out email updates weekly.

As it is right now, email updates go out as soon as a new post is made.  So about once a day if you post that much (a couple times per week in my case).

I've always thought this was a little too often and was afraid of annoying my readers with too many emails.  Unfortunately, FeedBurner doesn't offer an option to send them out weekly.  I would have to switch over to another service like Aweber or Feedblitz (which is pretty bad) to get a weekly email going out.

So I decided to put together a little poll.  Are you getting too many email from Breaking Free?

Note: [click here if you don't see the poll](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/), you will have to visit the actual web page.

Of course if you are subscribed via the RSS feed then this question doesn't really apply to you.  By the way, if you don't know what RSS is, check out [this YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0klgLsSxGsU):



I understand some people prefer to get email updates, but I personally use [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) for all the blogs I read and it is much better I think.
