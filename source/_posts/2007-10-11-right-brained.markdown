Follow this <a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22556281-661,00.html" title="Right Brain v Left Brain">link</a> to see an image that will help you determine if you are right-brained or left-brained.

I am right-brained, according to this test.  After concentrating at a point just below the image for a few seconds I was able to switch to the "left" side.
