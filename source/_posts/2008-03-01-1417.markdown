Still, I'd like to think that he was involved in the process somewhere, if only to give verbal approval that the message be sent.

Even so, it's pretty cool to get a <a href="http://growl.info" title="Growl Notification framework for Mac OS X">growl</a> notification of a new tweet and have it be one from a <a href="http://barackobama.com" title="Barack Obama for President">Presidential candidate</a>.
