As a boy I favored Johnny Cash records largely because he sang about trains (<i>Wreck of the Old 97</i>, <i>Orange Blossom Special</i>) and because <i>A Boy Named Sue</i> struck me as funny. For much of my life since then I haven't really followed him or his work, but hearing <i>I've Been Everywhere</i> recently got me interested in him again.

<i>American IV: The Man Comes Around</i> is darkly powerful, stark, almost foreboding in its overall sound. His voice is craggy, worn, and full of a lifetime of experience. And yet in the midst of what, from any other artist might be a nihilistic message, there is a thread of hope, of a light at the end of it all.
