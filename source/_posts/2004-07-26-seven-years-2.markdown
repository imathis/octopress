Seven years ago, on July 26, 1997, I was granted the rare privilege of marrying my best friend, my confidant, my lover, my true companion. She is a woman of uncompromising ethics, rare intelligence, emotional strength beyond measure, and quiet grace. It has been my honor to be her husband for the past seven years, and I am eagerly awaiting each day of the next seven and beyond.

Our relationship is founded on a deep trust, and emotional honesty. When life throws me a curve, or sneaks up on me from behind, Michele is always there with a safe place for me to fall. And when I triumph over an inner demon, or external challenge, she is my greatest fan.

This woman has faced turmoil and hardship time an again during her life. She has overcome obstacles I can't imagine enduring, much less growing from. She has a unique ability to find the positive lesson in the worst of circumstances. I am inspired by her courage, I consider myself successful when I am able to emulate her actions.

My greatest joy happens when I can make her happy, when I can make her laugh. My greatest sorrow is when I feel I have somehow failed in her eyes.

My Dearest Michele, I love you with all that I am, with all that I can be. You are my inspiration, my joy, my utter happiness. I am proud to be your husband, friend, companion, and lover. I would marry you again in an instant.

I love you Michele.
