[![How To Generate Million Dollar Business Ideas](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/diggthis1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/diggthis1.png)This is day 30 of my 30 day marketing challenge, to demonstrate that blogging can be a [profitable and inexpensive business to start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

By the way, please continue to [Digg this article](http://digg.com/business_finance/10_Ways_To_Come_Up_With_A_Million_Dollar_Business_Idea) on how to generate good business ideas.  It's starting to get some attention!

My three tasks for the day are...

1. I added the site to [Illumirate](http://www.illumirate.com)

2. I added the site to [Mavicanet](http://www.mavicanet.com/)

3. I added the site to [http://www.athomedirectory.com/](http://www.athomedirectory.com/)

These are all just other website directories that are less well known than Yahoo or DMOZ.  To be honest, it is day 30 and I have been having a hard time finding new marketing ideas!

In retrospect, I think 30 days is enough time to spend getting a bunch of SEO and link building done to the point where I can now focus on just posting good content to this website.

The foundation has been built.  Tomorrow I will make a post concluding this experiment and showing some of the results.
