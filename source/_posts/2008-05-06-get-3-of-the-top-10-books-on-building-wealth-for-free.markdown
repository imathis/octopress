Hi Folks,

I've at times given this out as a bonus with some of my books, but I decided to make it available to everyone.  Now when you [subscribe](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/subscribe/) to get weekly updates from StartBreakingFree.com by email, I'll send you PDF copies of 3 of the best-selling books of all time on building wealth.

What's great about these books is that they have stood the test of time and are now in the public domain, meaning their patent has expired and they can be given away for free.

  1. **Think and Grow Rich** Over 20 million copies sold and the best selling success book of all time!


  2. **The Way To Wealth** Benjamin Franklin's timeless advice from more than 150 years ago which is still as true today as ever.


  3. **The Richest Man In Babylon** A delightful set of parables that explain the basics of money and a personal favorite of mine.



If you haven't subscribed by email already please [go here](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/subscribe/) to get your free copies and feel free to forward this to any of your friends who may enjoy reading them as well.
