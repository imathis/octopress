<p>When the Nazis came for the communists,<br />
I remained silent;<br />
I was not a communist.</p>

<p>When they locked up the social democrats,<br />
I remained silent;<br />
I was not a social democrat.</p>

<p>When they came for the trade unionists,<br />
I did not speak out;<br />
I was not a trade unionist.</p>

<p>When they came for the Jews,<br />
I remained silent;<br />
I wasn't a Jew.</p>

<p>When they came for me,<br />
there was no one left to speak out.</p>
