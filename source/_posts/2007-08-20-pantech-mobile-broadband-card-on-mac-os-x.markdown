With the start of my new job last winter I treated myself to a mobile broadband card from Sprint.  This PCMCIA card allows me to connect to the Internet while at work (or anywhere else that doesn't have free Wi-Fi).  So far I have only used it in the ThinkPad as I wasn't able to get it to connect using the Powerbook.

As of right now, that is no longer the case.  The steps below allowed me to connect to the Internet using the Pantech 500 card.

Here's what I did:
<ol>
<li>Activate the card following Sprint's directions <i>in your Windows PC</i>.</li>
<li>Stick the card into the PCMCIA slot on your Powerbook (or MacBook, I suppose.)</li>
<li>Visit the Network preference pane in System Preferences and select the <strong>Pantech USB Modem</strong> entry from the list.</li>
<li>On the PPP tab put in the Provider name (optional) of Sprint, and the phone number of #777.  Leave all the other fields blank.</li>
<li>On the Modem tab, use the droplist to find <strong>Spring PCS Vision</strong>, and make sure that <strong>Wait for dial tone before dialing</strong> is unchecked.  Select the "Show modem status in menu bar if you like.</li>
<li>Close the Network preference pane and open <strong>Internet Connect</strong>.</li>
<li>Leave the Account name and password fields blank and click on <strong>Connect</strong>.
</ol>

You should now be connected.  Your mileage may vary.  Void where prohibited. Do not take internally.  Do not operate light machinery while connected. Not responsible for fire, pestilence, exploding batteries or other damage to you, your household, or computer if you follow these steps.
