It seems that the web-based keystroke counter I was using is gone. The dolphin project at bitdevil.com has been shut down as the project leader wishes to pursue other projects.

Since May 31, 2002 I typed a total of 1,921,551 keys at home and at work. Assuming a continuation of the same typing pace I would have reach about 3,200,000 keys in one year.

I'll have to look for another way to track this useless, but fun, statistic.
