Last night I took the first major step towards moving all the sites I own or manage to <a href="http://bluehost.com" title="Blue Host">Blue Host</a>.  Having learned from my first attempt at signing up, that the account name would be composed of characters from the initial domain name, I was faced with a bit of an issue.  Of the three domains I wanted to move or create at Blue Host, none decomposed into an account name I was happy with.

So I created a new domain.  I am now the proud owner of <a href="http://markhnichols.com" title="markhnichols.com">markhnichols.com</a>.

When I first registered zanshin.net, nearly twelve years ago, I had toyed with the idea of a domain using my name.  Now, I have a true vanity site.  For now that site will be an online copy of my professional resume.

Now that I have an account at Blue Host it is time to start migrating the sites from <a href="http://pair.com" title="pair.com">Pair.com</a> to their new home.  The hidden advantage to creating a new site as the first under the account is that moving existing ones can be done leisurely.  I can copy the contents and set everything up well before transferring the domain and updating the name server records.  As a result, there shouldn't be any down time as the sites move.

<b>NB</b>:  There is nothing wrong with Pair in my view.  I have been very happy with their services for a long time.  My site has never been down, and on those few occasions that I needed help, they were prompt and courteous.  My reasons for moving are purely monetary.  I can host four sites (and more) at Blue Host for a year, for roughly what 6 month's hosting at Pair cost.
