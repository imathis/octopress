Back in the day, when I was first exposed to computers, I played a text game called 'Star Trek' for hours. While my buddy (whose father had brought home from work the thermal paper terminal we were playing on) was enthralled with the game, I wanted to know how it worked. I had found my niche in life, and now, some 27 years later I discovered that the venerable 'emacs' editor included in most Unix distributions has several games embedded.

One of these is an adventure game called 'dunnet'. To play just open a terminal window and type (without the quotes) "<strong>emacs -batch -l dunnet</strong>" That's a dash el in the middle.

Don't blame me if your productivity goes to zero for the next few hours as you try not to get eaten by a grue.
