This year for Thanksgiving we'll be traveling to Illinois to see my father. Dad had knee replacement surgery just a week ago, and by all accounts is recovering very quickly. His home health care agreement restricts his ability to travel so rather than going to my brother's house, as has become the tradition in recent years, we'll be staying close to his home for the holiday.

I'm not sure we'll be having traditional fare, but I am certain there will be plenty of good food over a long relaxing day. The rest of the weekend will likely be spent sightseeing, with maybe a visit to my brother and his family.
