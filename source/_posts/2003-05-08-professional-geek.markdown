During the past year or so I have focused a lot of time and energy into this site, which reflects events and thoughts that I have as an individual. However, there is a professional side to me and it is with pleasure that I direct your attention to the newly revamped <a href="http://www.partitionsoftware.com" target="_blank">Partition Software</a> site.

The original Partition Software site has languished for too long with out being updated. Created at a time when I was learning DHTML, it made use of a fancy cascading menu, that unfortunately only worked when viewed thru Windows IE. And then only sometimes.

I am pleased with the lightness and simplicity of the new site layout. It satisfies my needs as a professional geek hoping to attract gainful attention. And it pleases my individual creativeness need.

<b>Update</b> (5.9.2003 @ 9:59 a)  Currently the partitionsoftware.com site is unavailable  as it seems I pulled the plug on my former hosting location too soon. The whois registry shows the new DNS information, but it hasn't trickled out to all the local servers yet.

<b>Update</b> (5.9.2003 @ 8:50 p) It looks like the DNS changes have finally filtered down to the local level. I'm able to view the site again. And my POP3 accounts are working.
