I haven't posted anything about the loss of <i>Columbia</i> until now. This was included in my weekly Palm Digital Media newsletter. I was touched and wanted to share it here, with you.


Out ride the sons of Terra,
Far drives the thundering jet,
Up leaps a race of Earthmen,
Out, far, and onward yet --

We pray for one last landing
On the globe that gave us birth;
Let us rest our eyes on the friendly skies
And the cool, green hills of Earth.

The Green Hills of Earth -- Robert A. Heinlein
