Today is my last day on this project. It has been a good two and a half years professionally, and a tumultuous time personally. There have been times when this project, with all its instability, frustrations, and issues has been the best part of my life.

I am very happy to say that this is no longer the case. Once again I feel like I have found balance in my life between work and play, between professional and personal, between living and working. I am moving towards something rather than trying to leave anything behind.

The coming days and weeks will hold new challenges and new opportunities. I'm going to feel like the kid who moved to a new school in the middle of the year for a while, and I'm sure I will have moments of doubt and fear. However, to some extent I get to wipe the slate clean and start over fresh. Since this is the first new job I've had in a decade that didn't also involve moving to a new city, I can focus more of my energy on the new position and not on the aftermath of moving.

To quote Calvin, from the final "Calvin and Hobbes" comic strip (31 December 1995):
