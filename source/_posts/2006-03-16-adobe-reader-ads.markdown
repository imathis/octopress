In setting up the ThinkPad one of the first pieces of software I installed was Adobe's PDF reader, now called, simply, Adobe Reader. With the proliferation of PDF files on the web and at work, having the reader installed is essential. I have a gripe, however, it displays ads in the toolbar area by default.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.pdfforlawyers.com/2003/09/adobe_reader_60.html" title="adobe reader 6.0">this posting</a> I learned how to turn the ads off forever.

<ul>
<li class="il">Open the Edit | Preferences menu item</li>
<li class="il">Select the Startup category</li>
<li class="il">Uncheck the option "Show messages and automatically update"</li>
</ul>

No more ads.
