As a student in American classrooms in the 1960s and 1970s I was introduced to the metric system in a failed attempt to join the world standard.  (That the United States is one of but <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Metric_system.png" title="Three countries that don't use the metric system">three countries on the planet</a> that doesn't use the metric system speaks volumes.)  Personally, I think the reason the metric system failed was making it about converting and not adopting.  Countless hours were spent in classrooms adding 32 and dividing by 5 before subtracting 32 and multiplying by 9 to know that 1 centimeter was a 100th of a meter regardless of whether it was freezing in Fahrenheit or Celsius.

So it should come as no surprise that this evening, while working out at our new gym, Sibylle and I discovered something interesting about the weights we'd been using.  About 18 months ago I joined another gym and was trained on a set of weight machines.  Being a nerd I carefully noted the seat position settings for each machine and the weight I was lifting for each.  I made a little card to carry with me so I wouldn't have to rely on memory.  Eventually I was able to remember the numbers without my cheatsheet.

On each of our three visits to the new gym this past week, I have done a few repetitions on the same set of weight machines the other club had.  And each time I was somewhat stunned by how heavy the weights were.  Could I really have lost that much strength in just a year and a half?

After straining to lift roughly half my prior weight again tonight, I remarked to Sibylle, "These weights are really heavy, I don't understand it."  Half joking she replied, "You don't suppose they are kilograms instead of pounds, do you?"

Suddenly a light bulb went off in my head.  The little "kilogram to pounds" conversion charts taped to some of the machines took on a whole new meaning.  100 didn't mean <em>pounds</em>, it meant 100 <em>kilograms</em> or 224 pounds.

Thanks to Sibylle's remark we now know that our new machines are in fact more than twice as heavy as the ones I'd used before.  And that a centimeter is still 100th of a meter, and that -40 F equals -40 C, and both are too cold for me.
