Despite a cyber-ish sounding name, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0408345/" title="Firewall">Firewall</a> isn't really about computers or hackers or even firewalls. It's really about a man trying to protect his family from bad guys. All in all not a bad movie, just not a great one either.

Rating: Wait for the DVD release
