Olive oil
1 package chicken breasts, rinsed and cut into cubes
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1/2 medium green pepper, finely chopped
2-3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 can diced or finely diced tomatoes
1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 bay leaves
1-2 tablespoons parsley
Salt
Pepper
5-6 squirts Tabasco
3 1/2 cups chicken stock (1 package)
1 package yellow rice (I use Vigo brand)
1 Can peas
Pimento

Heat 2-3 tablespoons oil over moderate heat in non-stick frying pan. Add chicken and cook until pale gold. Season with salt and pepper, turning frequently to evenly brown all sides. Transfer to heavy ovenproof casserole or stew pot with tight fitting lid.

Saut√© onion and green pepper in left over oil from chicken. Season with salt and pepper and cook until onion starts to turn gold. Toss in garlic and stir for another minute and then add can of diced tomatoes. Stir together and then pour mixture over chicken.

Add lemon juice, bay leaves, parsley, and hot sauce to chicken. Set aside enough stock to make rice according to package directions, in the case of Vigo 2 cups are needed. Pour remaining chicken stock over chicken and vegetable mixture, about 1 1/2 cups. Bring entire mixture to boil, then reduce heat and simmer with lid on for 15 minutes. (Meanwhile, preheat over to 325 degrees, removing oven rack to make room for stew pot/casserole.)

Once everything has simmered for 15 minutes, put set aside stock in saucepan and start to prepare yellow rice. Once rice is in the stock and has been brought to a boil, pour rice into stew pot. Bring entire mixture to a boil once again and then cover with lid and place in oven for 20-25 minutes.

At 20 minutes check the moisture level. Leaving it in the over a few minutes more will reduce the moisture. If desired warm peas in microwave. (If peas are placed on hot chicken they will warm by themselves.) Serve, allowing guests to add their own peas and pimento. Extra hot sauce maybe used individually as well. Serves 4-5 people.
