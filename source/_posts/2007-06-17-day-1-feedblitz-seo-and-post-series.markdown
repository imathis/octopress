This is the first day of the marketing challenge.  Here are the three things I got done today.  These aren't the sort of real traffic building activities I'd like to get to, but are more like pre-requisites to get the site together properly.

1. I moved the email newsletter service from [Zookoda](http://www.zookoda.com) to [FeedBlitz](http://www.feedblitz.com).  There were a few reasons for this, namely that Zookoda is really buggy and appears to have no-one supporting or correcting it anymore.  It's a shame because they had the best service out there (and it was free), but a little neglect here and there and the whole thing became unusable.  They must be focused on other activities. Feedblitz is quite good as well, but costs some money.

If you see an email from FeedBlitz, don't be alarmed.  Hopefully this change will allow the email newsletter to operate smoothly and draw people to the website with excerpts that grab their attention, and entice them to click "Read More".

2. I did some SEO.  Namely installing the [MetaTagz](http://www.brandonbuttars.com/2007/03/29/wordpress-meta-tags-plugin/) and [SEO Title Tag](http://www.netconcepts.com/seo-title-tag-plugin/) plugins.  And I finished going through some old posts to update the description, keyword, and title meta tags.

This will hopefully help the pages rank higher in Google over time to bring in more traffic.  SEO is an important part of building any business website.  It can get complicated and boring, so in most cases I suggest outsourcing to have a pro do it.  Your time is better spent elsewhere.

3. I installed the post series plugin, which you can see at the end of this page.  It helps generate more links for a series of posts so people keep reading longer.
