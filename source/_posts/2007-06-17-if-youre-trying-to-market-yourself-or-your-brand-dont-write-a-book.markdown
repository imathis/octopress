Checkout this great [interview](http://www.bestsellerinterviews.com/10-questions-with-seth-godin-author-of-permission-marketing-purple-cow-and-the-dip.html) with NYT Best Seller and marketing expert, Seth Godin.

He makes a few important points:



	
  * 58% of Americans never read another book after high school

	
  * The average American purchases one book per year, and probably doesn't get through the entire thing.

	
  * It's far easier to reach 1000 people today with a YouTube Video, or Blog, than it is with a book.



Keep this in mind when trying to spread your idea, product, or service.  How can you remove as many barriers as possible to help it spread?  It's far easier for someone to email a link to their friend, than it is for someone to remember your book title, drive to a bookstore, spend their hard earned money, and find time to read it.
