Here is a question from a Breaking Free reader that I though others might find useful (my response below)...


> Brian,

I would like some feedback on a business idea...

I'm thinking about a 3D scanning and 3D printing service with a website to solicit business.

A 3D scanner is around $3,000, and a 3D printer is about $15,000, so startup costs would be a little "high" I guess.  The scanner can scan an existing object, and convert it to a CAD file.  Then, with that file, someone could "print" a 3D object in ABS plastic, even if the part was complicated.  It is an efficient way to see/test a prototype idea.

Not sure how much market there is for something like that.  The client would need to ship an object to me to scan, and then I would probably be required to send the object back with an electronic CAD file.  And if I offered the "printing" service, I would send the ABS model back to them, all for a fee.  This is kind of a new thing developed in the last couple of years, and could save some companies money in their product development.  The startup cost probably keeps the small entrepreneur out of that market.  But, I could spend that much if I thought I could recoup my investment, and eventually make a profit.

Right now I am working part time for $10/hour at the local community college tutoring math.  I am a licensed Engineer in Texas, but finding a job is difficult.  If I could book 30 to 40 hours a week tutoring at $20 to $30 an hour, I might consider being ok with that.  I am a UniversityTutor.com tutor, but on my 3rd (free) referral, with just 1 client 1 hour a week at $20/hour.

Hi [Name Removed],

Interesting idea.  One way you could test it out is to see what keywords people are searching for on Google near where you live.  I'm not sure what keywords it would be exactly, but if you lived in Houston for example you might see how many searches are being done for "3d printing service houston" and keywords like that.  This would give you an idea of the market size.  You can use a tool like the [Google Keyword tool](https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal) for this type of research.

Then do those searches yourself and see what websites come up.  Are the results good? (i.e. people providing this service at a reasonable price)  Or do you feel you could do something substantially better marketing/price/customer service wise than what is currently out there?  What will be your competitive edge?

If you feel you can do substantially better in some way (i.e. there a market "pain" out there that you can solve), and you find a way to get the equipment (give equity to an investor, get it on business credit, etc) then you're right a website would be a great way to market this business.  You could create a business website with Wordpress like in [this article](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/).  You could also choose the domain name as www.3dprintinghouston.com (or whatever you decide your #1 keyword is) - this alone (the keyword as the domain name) will probably be enough to give you the first position in Google for that keyword.  Google gives a high weight to the domain name.

That would give you your first customers, or at least some traffic to your website.  How many customers would you need to get to pay back the business loans?  (Basically the total cost divided by the margin per item sold.  Note this would get you to zero - still no profit or compensation for your time - anything beyond that would be profit.)

To get setup you could start with the bare minimum.  Accept payments with a Paypal "Buy Now" button, put up some testimonials up, list an easy way for people to reach you, and a money back guarantee.  Don't invest too much time in getting things perfect - just start with the bare minimum to get something up quickly and improve from there.  With the Google traffic you should get some bites.

Finally, I'd think up front about how this will scale.  In other words, if this thing takes off are you going to have to be printing these models 8 hours per day and is that the sort of life you want?  If you don't want to do it yourself long term, are the margins there to hire someone else to help you so you could move into more of a manager role and scale that way?  In other words, be in this for the long haul - if you are passionate about this particular field for some reason and feel you could one day be the best in the world at it (at least in your local area) then go for it.  Because it could one day be a great company - but it will take years of hard work.  If it's not something you're passionate about it will be too easy to give up when the going gets tough.  But if you're passionate about it (or find a related business that you are) then I say go for it.  You'll never know unless you try!

**In the comments below, what other advice would you (Breaking Free readers) give him?**

Hope it helps!
