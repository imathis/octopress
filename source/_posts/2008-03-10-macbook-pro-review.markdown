<a href="http://shawnblanc.net" title="shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a> has put up an excellent <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2008/review-macbook-pro/" title="MacBook Pro Review">review of his new 15" MacBook Pro</a> over at his site.  In the <em>Unchanging</em> section of the review he makes the point that Apple products age very well:
<blockquote>... it is not uncommon to see someone still using their four or five-year-old PowerBook on a daily basis. Even though 5 years is a virtual eternity in computer-land...</blockquote>
My Powerbook is now moving into its sixth year of faithful service; that I carry it to work over the two-year old ThinkPad is a testament to what Shawn is saying.

Of course, his review only further whets my appetite for a new MacBook Pro of my own.
