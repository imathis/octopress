Remember the new billing/invoice system I [designed and launched](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/?p=857) for UniversityTutor.com?

Things aren't looking very promising so far. They started off well and in the first week or two about a dozen invoices got processed through the site.

I figured it would slowly trend upwards from there as people started adopting it, but in the past week not a single new invoice has come through the site.

On average about 40 tutors per day get contacted through the site for jobs. If (conservatively) just 20% of these ended up meeting with the student, then I should be getting 8 invoices per day. But that is of course if they only met with the student once. Some tutors end up meeting with the same student twice a week for a year, and others just once. But the average would certainly be at least 2 or 3 times (again, conservatively) meaning the number of invoices being processed per day should probably be at least 20. But it's no where near this. Tutors simply aren't using the new system.

I've been in contact with the tutors and students who HAVE used it to get feedback. There were a few minor problems (a bug with Amex cards not going through - now resolved) and some tutors were concerned with the 3-4 business takes it took for the direct deposit to show up in their account, but otherwise they were happy and it's functioning as designed so the lack of adoption is somewhat puzzling.

One thought that occurred to me today: I sent out an email and blog post announcing the new system when it came out, but there may be some tutors who simply didn't read the email or have forgotten about the new change.

**Lot's of email doesn't get read and when it does people often skim it. An average open rate for a mass email is about 30%.**

If they were to login to their account they would notice immediately that something was new. But I realized today that many tutors probably have no need to login to their account. Their profile is already created and they simply receive emails from people looking to hire them and reply to the emails. They may vaguely remember seeing an email from me a few weeks back about a new feature, but since they still have no need to login they will probably just go through business as usual (accepting cash/check afterwards) and not think twice about it.

I did have one idea to resolve this: Those 40 contacts per day are another chance to reinforce the benefits of the new system:



	
  * Getting positive reviews from clients

	
  * Hours of experience increasing


So I've just added a new line in the emails that go out when tutors get contacted by students. Hopefully this will help remind them RIGHT before they start working with a new client:


> A new student has contacted you from your profile on UniversityTutor.com! Please get in touch with them as soon as you can.

After working with a student, make sure to send them an invoice and get paid online. This will ensure the student can leave you a positive review and your hours of experience will be updated.

...


The second line is the new part. Hopefully this helps. I'll have to see.

If ultimately the benefits of this new billing/invoice system are not convincing enough to get tutors to pay online, then I may have to think about going back to the old system (charging tutors $10/month). This old business model was certainly working, it just wasn't growing as fast as I'd like. The percentage based business model has a lot of advantages, but what remains to be seen is if tutors will actually use it.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
