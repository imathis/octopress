I had an interesting conversation with [Neil Patel](http://www.quicksprout.com/) earlier this week.  I called him to get some advice on [UniversityTutor.com](http://www.UniversityTutor.com) and how I could take it to the next level.  Neil is a really successful guy in the web business space, so I figured it'd be a good brainstorm.

His biggest advice was to get more incoming links to the site.  This is probably the most important thing you can do to rank well in search engines, because Google (and others) place a high value on how many sites link to you.  It's also a great barrier to entry against competitors because an established site will have lots of incoming links built up over time and it will be very difficult for a new startup to outrank them in search engines.

I'm already ranking well for some local searches (such as [biology tutor austin](http://www.google.com/search?q=biology+tutor+austin&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a))  but not so well in other (such as [find a tutor](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=YBf&q=find+a+tutor&aq=f&oq=&aqi=g-s10)).  This is largely due to how long those sites have been around and how many incoming links they have.

So obviously getting more links is good, but HOW was the big question.  Neil's advice was to follow the same model [Yelp.com](http://www.Yelp.com) used with their [user badges](http://www.yelp.com/bling).  This lets Yelp users display their reviews on their own blog or website.  They get to show off their work, and Yelp get's an incoming link.  You just have to provide users with a little snippet of code and an incentive to paste it into their site.

So a day later I had launched tutor "bling" that my tutors can add to their own websites (blogs, school websites, facebook profiles, etc).  Since a lot of the tutors are university students, it would be particularly great if I got some incoming .edu links (these carry a particularly high value) but we'll have to see on that.

As an added incentive I built in my [UniversityTutor affiliate program](http://www.universitytutor.com/about/affiliate) so all the pre-generated links contain a tutor's affiliate code (they can track it using the stats at the bottom).  Using this they can not only advertise their profile, but also get paid for any new tutors they refer.

**One More Idea....**

This wasn't related to my conversation with Neil, but I thought about it after reading a story on Hotmail.com.  Hotmail got popular FAST (something like 2 million users in 18 months) almost entirely because they forced you to include a line in the bottom of every email that said "Get A Free Email Account At Hotmail.com", or something to that effect.

There are over 100 contact messages going through UniversityTutor.com every day now, so I decided to add a line to the bottom of their contact emails reminding them of the opportunity to refer new tutors and get paid for it.  You can see the new line in the email below.  This is more for word of mouth than SEO because I don't think Google will index links from someone's Facebook profile.

So what do you think, will it work?  Here is a graph of search engine traffic to UniversityTutor.com over the last three months (traffic from search engines makes up about 50% of total traffic).

It will probably take a month or two to have any effect (if it works), but we'll see!

Until next time, keep breaking free!
