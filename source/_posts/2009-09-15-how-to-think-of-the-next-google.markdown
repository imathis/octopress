I've been in sort of a holding pattern the last few weeks since I'm between projects and the ones I have are all running on auto-pilot.  For the most part I am well rested with nothing especially urgent to do and this has given me some great time to think.

Some people call this taking time to "sharpen the saw".  I've been talking and meeting with other entrepreneurs, doing lots of reading, finding new sources of inspiration, and today I did some brainstorming.

This is one of the real benefits of not having a job: you can take time in the middle of the day to be creative, think about the future, and develop your long term goals and skills.

By the way, brainstorming seems to work better with a blank sheet of paper and a pen.  There is something about doing this by hand which is important.  It separates you from the computer and distractions, and there is something about moving your hand that makes you more creative.  And it's harder to focus if you try this while driving through traffic or something.  Writing it really helps.

Anyway, here are some interesting questions I came up with:



	
  1. **What's going to be the next thing to go online?**
The internet has disrupted so many old businesses, it's safe to assume this trend will continue.  Dating went online, along with music, project management, plane tickets, telephone calls, television, and movies.  Sure these things take time, but from an entrepreneurial point of view, internet has already killed television.  It's too late to jump on that ship.  I wish I had invented Skype, but someone else already did it.  So what is going to be the next thing to move online?  Maybe it will be buying real estate (the whole transaction from start to finish), sending physical objects to each other by email attachment (imagine hitting print and getting a 3D object like a toaster out somehow), running scientific experiments through the internet (test tubes in the cloud?), or - and I hesitate to mention this - people having virtual sex through the internet with some kind of robots?  Who knows...all of those could happen in our lifetime, and somebody is going to make a killing off it.

	
  2. **What technology do I want to make obsolete?  What's inefficient?**
This is another way to look at it.  What is old and broken.  Why isn't there a startup doing health insurance that would cover you for life?  Man...I would sign up for that, if I knew they could never drop me for a pre-existing condition or too many illnesses.  That would be a great feature to attract new business.  Sure, they could probably only take young people right now to be profitable over time (and wouldn't be a solution for people who currently can't get coverage), but it could be great in the long term.  The real estate buying process is still light years behind the rest of the world, why hasn't anyone fixed that?  What about the DMV, and doing your taxes.  Sadly, it is no coincidence that when you start thinking about inefficient businesses they seem to be all be affected by government in some way.  This makes them less attractive to entrepreneurs, and I don't blame them, but there is still some opportunity there.

	
  3. **What are people currently paying for that I can make free somehow?**
I call this the "PlentyOfFish" model.  Basically, they took a product that everyone was paying for (online dating) and made a free, ad-supported, alternative.  Ad-supported is sort of a bad word these days, but it could still work.  What's too expensive?  Paypal, internet access, international calls...not sure.

	
  4. **What is life going to be like 10 years from now in 2019?**
It's so easy to get caught up in thinking  "shoot! if I had only thought of Amazon.com (or Twitter, Google, Basecamp, etc.)  in 1999 I could have beat them!"  But that's not productive because back in 1999 those guys were sitting around NOT thinking about what they could have done in 1989, they were thinking about what the world was going to be like in 2009 and then they got to work on making it happen.  So the question we need to be asking today is what the world is going to be like in 2019, and what businesses is that world going to make possible that aren't possible today?  I don't know about you but I envision every movie we see being in 3D, there being dirt cheap projectors and flat screens showing up everywhere (kind of like minority report where the walls of our house are built out of these things and they're on cereal boxes, etc).  Everyone will probably be zipping around in electric vehicles.  I hope they do something with airlines too, where they are much faster and easier to board and you can get anywhere in the world in a few hours.  There will probably be a lot more robots too that we start interacting with.  What kind of businesses will this enable?  Probably lots, but I for one would like to see some innovative art come out of this.  Why not have new (digital) paintings on our walls every day that we can give a thumbs up or thumbs down to so it learns our preferences over time.  Maybe we can make some of those painting like in the Harry Potter movies where the portraits of people move and their eyes follow you.  Maybe we can digitize people's brains and keep their memories on flash drives, or even run their brains in a human simulator on our computers so can still ask them questions after they pass away.  Creepy, but probably useful somehow.

	
  5. **How can I empower people to get all the basic stuff they need in life?**
Charity is cool too, but I'm more for enabling people to help themselves (the fishing pole, not the fish).  What can you do that would make people richer?  This is where I started thinking about how to eliminate taxes, but I'll save that for another post, haha.


The next Google is hidden in exercises like this; one of us need to implement it.  I'm curious to hear your take on these questions as well in the comments.
