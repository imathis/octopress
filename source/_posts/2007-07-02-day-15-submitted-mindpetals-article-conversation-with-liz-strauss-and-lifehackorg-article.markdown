[![Toastmasters](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/toastmasterslogo1-150x150.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/toastmasterslogo1.gif)Today is day 15 of my 30 day challenge to [bring more *readers* to this blog](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/), and demonstrate that blogging can be a profitable business.

By the way, Darren posted the first part of my [review on Rss-to-Email providers](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/07/03/rss-to-email-comparison-review-feedburner-feedblitz-zookoda-aweber/).

My three tasks for today were:

1. Finished the article on Toastmasters for [MindPetals.com](http://www.mindpetals.com/)

2. I had a great conversation with Liz Strauss of [Successful-blog.com](http://www.successful-blog.com/).  She contacted me based on my [Day 13 post](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-13-successful-and-outstanding-bloggers-list-backlinks-advice-from-yaro-and-dmoz/) and gave a new perspective on blogging.  As she put it, some bloggers are marketing people, and some are relationships people.  Liz is a big proponent of the relationships type, since this is blogging's biggest strength.  Some things that I got out of it were:



	
  * Don't think about 'traffic', think about 'readers'

	
  * Don't do a report, just talk about your own personal experience

	
  * A news article ends by making a point or coming to a conclusion, but blog should generate discussion and be interactive.  It's is not one person's thoughts, it is many people's thoughts.

	
  * To generate discussion there are a number of things you can do...

	
  * Be authentic and let them know there is a real person behind the blog

	
  * Don't always end the post with an answer, leave an open ended question

	
  * Encourage readers to contribute their own ideas, the community will generate more insight than one person



Anyway, these were just a few ideas.  It was good to meet a more successful blogger and actually speak to them on the phone (so far I've only emailed back and forth with a few).  I hope to go to some blogging conferences in the future and meet more of them face to face!

3. I wrote and submitted my next LifeHack.org contributing article which was due yesterday!

Contributing articles to other sites has still been my biggest generator of subscribers.
