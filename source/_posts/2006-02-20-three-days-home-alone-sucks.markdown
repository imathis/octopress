Three days at home by myself is driving me nuts. And like a fool I agreed to be here today so that the idiot water delivery guy could come and get my empties - so I can't leave and escape my cabin fever.

I used to look forward to every minute at home, I relished having long unbroken stretched of time away from work. Now I spend my weekend looking forward to Monday morning and the return to work. I miss the socialization of being around people. Being here by myself is awful. My frustration builds and builds until it bubbles out in the form of anger - usually at one of the cats. Which isn't fair to them and always leaves me feeling like a heel.

For years I used to think that working from home would be great. And it might have been if I was here with Michele. Now, you couldn't pay me to work from home. I'd go mad in a week.

I may blow off the water guy and go window shopping this afternoon. I need to get out of here.
