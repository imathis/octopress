You probably hear good business ideas on a regular basis.  But how do you know if they'll be right for you?

Here is a quick checklist I like to go through to analyze a new business idea and decide if it's right for me.

  1. Would it solve a [real problem](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/are-you-creating-a-product-that-nobody-needs/) or am I fixing something that isn't broken?

	
  2. Could I be the best in the world at it (at least in this niche)?

	
  3. Will it be inexpensive and quick to test out in case it doesn't work?  (remember, 9 out of 10 of your ideas [probably won't work](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/9-businesses-i-started-which-utterly-failed/), and that's great - it's the only way to succeed - just try to do it fast and cheap)

	
  4. Am I passionate enough to make it through [the dip](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841666?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591841666) or will I lose interest in six months?



Regarding #2, I usually just Google it to check out the competition.  Keep in mind that people can become very comfortable with their old, regular way of doing something.  There is a cost to them of switching to your new service.  Even if yours is a little bit better they still have to spend their time and brain power learning a new system and taking the risk that it might not work for them.  They might not even think to LOOK for an alternative if their current system is "good enough".

So you can't just be a little bit better - a prettier color scheme for example.  You have to be "enough better" that it's worth it for them to switch.  The best situation you can find is one where most people hate the only available solution, and are actively searching for an alternative.

This is the case with accounting software like Quicken and Quickbooks, for example.
