From <em>Henry V</em>, this <a title="Once More Unto The Breach" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_more_unto_the_breach">speech</a> seems fitting today.

Henry V:-

<dl>
<blockquote><dd>"This day is called the feast of Crispian:</dd> <dd>He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,</dd> <dd>Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,</dd> <dd>And rouse him at the name of Crispian.</dd> <dd>He that shall live this day, and see old age,</dd> <dd>Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,</dd> <dd>And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'</dd> <dd>Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.</dd> <dd>And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'</dd> <dd>Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,</dd> <dd>But he'll remember with advantages</dd> <dd>What feats he did that day: then shall our names.</dd> <dd>Familiar in his mouth as household words</dd> <dd>Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,</dd> <dd>Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,</dd> <dd>Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.</dd> <dd>This story shall the good man teach his son;</dd> <dd>And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,</dd> <dd>From this day to the ending of the world,</dd> <dd>But we in it shall be remember'd;</dd> <dd>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;</dd> <dd>For he to-day that sheds his blood with me</dd> <dd>Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,</dd> <dd>This day shall gentle his condition:</dd> <dd>And gentlemen in England now a-bed</dd> <dd>Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,</dd> <dd>And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks</dd> <dd>That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day"</dd></blockquote>
