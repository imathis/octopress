1. What makes you homesick?
Not being at home, I guess.

2. Where is "home" for you? Is it where you are living now, or somewhere else (i.e., Mom & Dad's house, particular state/city)?
Currently central Illinois. Recently South Carolina, and before that Oregon. Eventually someplace with good spiritual energy.

3. What makes it home for you? People? Things?
My home is where my Sweetie is, so anywhere can do.

4. Where is the furthest you've been from home, miles-wise? 5000. I did a two-week tour of the Alps on motorcycle in 1994. Awesome.

5. What are your plans for this weekend?
The spring rains have started, so we'll most likely stay home and dry, bake a chocolate cake and make a pot of spaghetti
