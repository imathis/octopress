My father introduced me to author John McPhee years ago with a volume entitled, <i>The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed</i>. The unlikely title referred to a new lifting vehicle, or rigid lighter-than-air balloon. McPhee's essays are about people and things, and are told with rare grace and deft use of language. They are a joy to read.

<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374280398/sr=8-1/qid=1152922235/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0902243-2034365?ie=UTF8" title="Uncommon Carriers">Uncommon Carriers</a></i> is about coal trains, and barge traffic on the Illinois River. It's about over-the-road trucking, and the package sort at UPS in Memphis. It's mostly about the people who inhabit these uncommon modes of moving goods.

Rating: Uncommonly good.
