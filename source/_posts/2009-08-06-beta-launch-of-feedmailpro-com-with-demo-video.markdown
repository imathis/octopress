wordpress_id: '1055'

Last week I told you about a [new project](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/my-next-project/) I was working on, and I wanted to give you a sneak peak at how it's going!

WARNING: this is a beta launch, and the site is still being developed.  So I DON'T recommend you start using it for your main newsletter or move your list over yet.  This is just for testing purposes.  I also ask that you don't post about it anywhere else yet.  I want to keep the beta launch small and manageable (besides, it will be much more profitable for you to post about it once I have the affiliate program set up!)  Lots of things will be changing going forward.

The URL to check it out is [http://feedmailpro.com](http://feedmailpro.com)

A couple points worth mentioning:

1. Yes it has the same layout/design as [BuyersVote.com](http://buyersvote.com). I did this just because it was the simplest and fastest way to get the site up quickly, and I like how it looks.  The design comes from [this](http://designdisease.com/portfolio/blogging-pro-theme/) open source wordpress theme by Design Disease.

Just as a side note: I personally don't think it's worth spending much time on the design when launching a Web 2.0 company.  If you have an awful design, I suppose it could hurt, but as long as you have something that is good enough, and doesn't get in the way of your main message, then it's not that important.  Your time is better spent elsewhere in the early stages (like on the product).  When the thing takes off you can always go back and get a professional design done.

2. If you read the comments from my [last post](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/my-next-project/) you may have noticed that my friend Erica brought up some very good points about the difficulties in running this type of business (namely, communicating with ISP's to keep your deliverability rates up).  She was absolutely right and I got in touch with her for some advice.  After talking for a bit, we figured there might be a way to outsource the delivery part of it since it was something I definitely did not want to deal with (it was not passive at all).  After some research I turned up [this company (ISIPP or SuretyMail)](http://www.isipp.com/email-accreditation/) who do exactly that: email accreditation and deliverability.  It turns out this is actually how Aweber themselves do it (they are a customer) along with a bunch of other well known email service providers (Constant Contact, etc).  So I have to give a big thank you to Erica for helping me out on that one.

Obviously hiring a company like that is not a panacea and I'm 100% sure there will still be some sort of unexpected problems to deal with down the road (as with every startup), but at least this was a step in the right direction.

3. Finally, check out the [2 minute video demo I put together](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BYUIydVldg).  It shows a quick overview and how easy it will be to move your account over from Aweber.  There is no doubt about it, I'm looking to steal a TON of business from Aweber on this one.  They probably won't be happy about that and I need to be careful and make sure to do everything by the books.  But at the same time, they've been getting away with robbery for so long now with a mediocre product that it's about time they got some competition.  Consumers will ultimately be the winner here by getting a better product for less money, and that's really the beauty of capitalism at work.



The video works best in fullscreen.

I still need to add some more features like:



	
  * generating the signup code for people to use on their blogs

	
  * the billing system and affiliate program (will be copying lots of code from UniversityTutor here so it won't take long)

	
  * a way to automate adding subscribers with an API

	
  * some more spam prevention stuff

	
  * a way for people to send one-time email blasts which aren't from their RSS feed


But most of the basic functionality is there.  At least enough to start getting feedback on it.

Please take a moment to check it out at [http://feedmailpro.com](http://feedmailpro.com) and let me know what you think!

**Please send me your thoughts on what you like and don't like about it in the comments below.  If you encounter any strange bugs feel free to report them in the [FeedmailPro Support Forum](http://groups.google.com/group/feedmailpro/topics) I set up.**

Until next time, keep breaking free!
