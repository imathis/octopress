Michael Masterson from Early To Rise wrote a [great article](http://www.earlytorise.com/2007/06/29/do-you-have-what-it-takes.html) (you'll have to scroll down a bit) on mentality behind entrepreneurship.

Many people assume they don't have what it takes because they aren't risk takers.  Risk-loving and entrepreneurship do not go hand in hand.  In fact, it turns out that often the most successful entrepreneurs are those best at minimizing risk.





> The natural entrepreneur is good at coming up with ideas, but not so good at following up on them. "I’m an idea person," such entrepreneurs will tell you. "I’m not good with details."

In saying that, these people are suggesting that the ability to come up with ideas is more important than the skill of implementing them. But as Robert Ringer says in Action!, no idea has any value until it is carried out. The secret of success in business is the ability to combine innovation and implementation.

If, like my friend PG, you have been putting off the decision to strike out on your own because you don’t know if you have "what it takes," consider the case I am making here: If having what it takes means having the classic entrepreneurial personality, you may be better off with the personality you have.
