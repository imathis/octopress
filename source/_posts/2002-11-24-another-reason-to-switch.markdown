I saw <a href="http://www.spiny.com/comictastic/">this</a> over at <a href="http://www.whatdoiknow.org/">what do I know</a> this weekend. It's software that resides on your Mac and downloads up to 150 different comics each day for your reading pleasure. Since the comics are the only reason I ever buy a newspaper this is most excellent. Now all I need is a Mac. Donations can be sent to me.
