A year ago when I signed up for the <a href="http://www.nablopomo.com/" title="NaBloPoMo">NaBloPoMo</a> (National Blog Posting Month) I saw a surge in site visits.  A typical month for me sees about 525 page views and maybe 350 visitors.  November last year had more than 850 page views, largely due to the NaBloPoMo.  This year I have seen no difference in my site visits or page views.  In fact, November maybe lagging a tiny bit behind the average.

I suspect that there are far more participants in the month of blogging this time around, so that my site is lost in a bigger field of possibilities.  I also fully understand the idea of a power curve, and recognize the <a href="http://zanshin.net" title="zanshin.net">zanshin.net</a> is way out on the thin part of the curve.

All the articles I've read about creating a site that will generate visitors center around the idea of a theme for the site.  Not a visual theme, but rather a contextual one.  Sites that focus on some specific topic or genre collect a following and that following starts to attract links from other sites.  My site has been, and will continue to be, a place for me to explore topics that interest me.  I guess you could say that the genre here is <i>Mark</i>.

So to those of you who are regulars here, I say thanks.
