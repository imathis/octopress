For no particular reason yesterday, other than wanting something to fill the day, I watched the entire <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy. Extended version of course. Weighing in at a svelte 682 minutes running time (that's eleven hours and 22 minutes), the extended edition more than filled the day for me. I didn't get started until shortly after 8:00 in the morning, and I had breaks for meals, showering, and a phone call or two. By 10:30 in the evening I was within an hour of the conclusion and determined to complete the film in one sitting.

It is just as good as the last time I saw it, and the first time too. Like a legion of fans I am eagerly awaiting Peter Jackson's <em>The Hobbit</em> to complete my Middle Earth collection.
