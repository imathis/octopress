Last June I installed <a href="http://shortstat.shauninman.com/" title="ShortStat">ShortStat</a> so I could see who was visiting zanshin and from where. At the time we were on the verge of a cross-country move and when the initial setup failed to work I put it on the back burner.

In September after most of the dust from the move had settled I had time to debug my ShortStat installation and discovered I had a PHP functions files called "functions.php" and ShortStat also had a "functions.php" file. Once I renamed my instance everything worked like a charm. So even though I installed ShortStat on June 21st, I didn't start collecting statistics until September 11.

In the three months since ShortStat has been active on zanshin there have been 10,113 site hits from 2171 unique visitors. That's on pace to be over 40,000 page views in a single year. Wow. Now I realize that some portion of these page views are automated robots; in fact 37 percent are "crawlers" of one form or another. Still that leaves better than 6370 non-crawler page views in three months time. Or roughly 25,000 pages served to humans in a years time.

It just boggles my mind that my thoughts will be viewed twenty-five thousand times this year.
