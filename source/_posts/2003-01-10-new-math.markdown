Conversation at the cafeteria check out this morning:

Me: Two sausage and three bacon
Cashier: $5.20
Me: Say what?!
Cashier: The prices went up, bacon and sausage is now $0.50 each.
Me: So....
Cashier: So it's $5.20
Me: I don't think so. 5 times $0.50 equals $2.50.
Cashier: But the machines says $5.20
Me: Then the machine is wrong.
Cashier: 2 sasuage...
Me: ...is a dollar
Cashier: and 3 bacon...
Me: ... is another dollar fifty for a total sans tax of $2.50.
Cashier: Oh... I did it wrong
Me: (inside my head) No shit.
Cashier: (after void and subtracting for a minute or so) $2.25.
Me: Thank you!

Gotta love people who can't add.
