[Thebookr.com](http://thebookr.com) is a site I was contracted to build last year, and it has finally launched!

Joyce and I met up at a hacker meetup in Mountain View, CA last year.  She was looking for a developer to make the idea a reality.  I liked the business idea and technically it was somewhat similar to UniversityTutor, so we worked out a price and I went to work.

I think it turned out really well.

There are a few reasons I think this could be a really good business for her.

First, the idea of building a marketplace online has turned out to be one of the best types of businesses.  Whether it's Airbnb, iStockPhoto, eBay, or CarWoo!, the internet has made plenty of markets more efficient.

Second, the fashion industry is one of the few industries that hasn't been disrupted yet.  There are still brick and mortar agencies taking outrageous fees (about 40%) as commissions and slowing down communication between bookers and talent.

The site is perfect for retailers or people doing commercial work to find talent for their next shoot.  Or models (even if it's not their full time job) looking for additional work.

If you know anyone who might be interested, have them [check out the site here to find a model or become a model](http://thebookr.com).
