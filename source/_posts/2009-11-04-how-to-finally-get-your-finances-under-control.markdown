Check out this page Ramit Sethi put together about [getting your finances under control](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/iwtytbr/).  It's generally great advice and I do quite a lot of it already, like setting up automatic deposits to my ING Direct savings accounts.

Here is an email he got from a reader...

I'm 30 and a little behind on saving for the future, plus my boyfriend is a post-doc and not making a ton, so I'm kinda saving for both of us... yadda yadda) Essentially, I love the automation idea, I am just not sure how to start automating my life...

Other than those two, I have no idea what to invest in. I like the idea of keeping a close tab on the 401K but let's face it, I just put it in a lifecycle fund and haven't touched it since. What else do I invest in? Basically, I just want out of the rat race."

If it sounds familiar then check out what his [response](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/iwtytbr/) was.  Financial education is too important to be left to chance.  Speaking of which, have you done your [financial statements](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-and-create-a-personal-financial-statement-each-month-in-5-minutes/) for October?
