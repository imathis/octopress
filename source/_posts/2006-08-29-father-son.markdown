Last spring, in one of the final conversations I had with my Mom, she expressed a concern for my Dad, her husband. She said that she didn't know what he was going to do. I promised her that I would look after him. I told her that I was planning on offering to be a Sherpa for his camera equipment if he wanted to take a trip somewhere to shoot pictures.

He was delighted with the idea and we eventually decided that I would join him for a week on the Oregon coast while he attended a seminar there. He is driving out with stops along the way, and I am flying into Portland; then we travel to the Oregon - California border for a week of photography. I am not the photo enthusiast he is, but I am looking forward to seeing the beautiful scenery and, more importantly, spending some time with my Dad.

I know all too well how fleeting time with loved ones can be, so I am glad for me as well as him, for this opportunity. I have finally let go of the need for him to meet my father needs. I've found ways to meet those on my own, thus freeing our relationship to be more friendly. I think we are going to have a good time together in Oregon.
