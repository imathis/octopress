[![The Richest Man In Babylon](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/11/richest1-150x150.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRichest-Man-Babylon-George-Clason%2Fdp%2F0451205367%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1194837601%26sr%3D8-2&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)I started re-reading one of my all time favorite books this week, [The Richest Man In Babylon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRichest-Man-Babylon-George-Clason%2Fdp%2F0451205367%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1194837601%26sr%3D8-2&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325).

The principles to building wealth really haven't changed much in several hundred years, and this book has been around forever.  Building wealth isn't that hard; just look at what successful people are doing and model it.  Trying to do things your own way or taking advice from those without a proven track record is what gets you in trouble.

The book is told in parable form.  Through some interesting characters and memorable stories the book is able to convey its lessons much more effectively than if they simply made a list of points to remember.  Even if they are talking about building chariots and selling sheep, the lesson still applies to modern day.  (Side Note: I find this is an effective technique in public speaking as well: make a point and then back it up with a personal story or anecdote.  It really drives the point home.)

As an excerpt from one chapter, here are seven cures for a lean purse, which each contain a story behind them:



	
  1. Start thy purse to fattening

	
  2. Control thy expenditures

	
  3. Make thy gold multiply

	
  4. Guard thy treasures from loss

	
  5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment

	
  6. Insure a future income

	
  7. Increase thy ability to earn
