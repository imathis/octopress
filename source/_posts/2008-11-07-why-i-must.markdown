I have a file always on my desktop titled "Why I Must".

Inside it, I've written down (over the last year or so) the reasons why I must become financially independent working for myself.

There are about 20 reasons (some of them personal), but for example, I know that I can never really contribute to the world if I have to spend 40 hours a week working for someone else.  There just isn't enough time.  I also know that it is the only way I'll be able to travel the world for a year and continue to earn money.  These are important goals in my mind.

Why is it so important to have a reason you MUST?  Well, if it's just something you WANT, instead of a MUST, then when you hit the first setback (and there will be many) you'll give up.

What is your reason?  Is it spending more time with your kids?  Is it building your dream house?  Is it being financially able to provide for your family?  Whatever it is please take a moment to write it down (in the comments if it isn't too personal).  If you don't write it down, it doesn't count.

That way, when you hit your first setback and stop to ask yourself "why am I doing this?", you'll have an answer.
