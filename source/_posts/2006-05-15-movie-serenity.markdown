I remember being pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0379786/" title="Serenity">Serenity</a> last fall when I saw it in the theater. When I discovered it was out on DVD I grabbed a copy. It has the perfect mix of black humor, likable characters, and engaging plot.

Rating: Destined to be a long-time favorite.
