Vanity Fair is running a chilling, sobering article by Christopher Hitchens on the subject of waterboarding, called "<a title="Believe Me, It's Torture" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/08/hitchens200808?currentPage=1">Believe Me, It's Torture</a>." In short, it's torture.  In it, he quotes Malcom Nance's denunciation of waterboarding,
<blockquote>1. Waterboarding is a deliberate torture technique and has been prosecuted as such by our judicial arm when perpetrated by others.

2. If we allow it and justify it, we cannot complain if it is employed in the future by other regimes on captive U.S. citizens. It is a method of putting American prisoners in harm’s way.

3. It may be a means of extracting information, but it is also a means of extracting junk information. (Mr. Nance told me that he had heard of someone’s being compelled to confess that he was a hermaphrodite. I later had an awful twinge while wondering if I myself could have been “dunked” this far.) To put it briefly, even the C.I.A. sources for the <em>Washington Post</em> story on waterboarding conceded that the information they got out of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was “not all of it reliable.” Just put a pencil line under that last phrase, or commit it to memory.

4. It opens a door that cannot be closed. Once you have posed the notorious “ticking bomb” question, and once you assume that you are in the right, what will you <em>not</em> do? Waterboarding not getting results fast enough? The terrorist’s clock still ticking? Well, then, bring on the thumbscrews and the pincers and the electrodes and the rack.</blockquote>
