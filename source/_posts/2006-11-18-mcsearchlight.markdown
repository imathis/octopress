Here in Kansas City a new trend in McTastlessness. Several of the local burger chain are now sporting spotlights on their roofs. At night when you are driving you'll see a searchlight panning back and forth across the night sky, and if you follow it, you will end up and Ronald's place.

How on earth did McDonald's convince various local municipalities to allow them to further pollute the night sky with searchlights just so wayward teenagers will know where they can "get some fries with that?"
