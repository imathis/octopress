Michele and I had a perfectly wonderful weekend. On Saturday we drove up to Normal and visited my brother and his family for an early Christmas. Since we won't be in town for the actual day we decided to meet and share our present early. On the way we stopped at the only Vietnamese restaurant in central Illinois for a bowl of beef noodle soup. Our lunch was fantastic, and our time together with my brother's family was relaxed and very enjoyable.

On Sunday we were lazy in the morning and then decided to have lunch out at Lone Star. Afterwards we went to see 'Analyze That' for a treat. The movie was great, even better than the first. The theater wasn't crowded and the people who were there were quiet.

After we got home I brought in the Christmas tree box and set the tree up in the corner. We then spent some time decorating the tree and mantle with our Santa ornaments and lights. The room is very Christmassy and beautiful now. We celebrated by relaxing on the couch with a cold glass of eggnog and "It's a Wonderful Life" on the DVD player.

For dinner we ate leftover beef stew, which was delicious and easy. We rounded out the day by going out for ice cream and then driving around looking at Christmas lights in town.

A very special, joyous weekend spent with family and getting into the Christmas spirit.
