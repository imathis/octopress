John Warrillow sent me a copy of his book recently (one of the perks of having a business blog) and it was surprisingly good.

The book is titled "[Built To Sell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0986480304?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0986480304)" - which actually turned me off a bit at first.  It reminded me of "Built To Last", the famous business book by Jim Collins, except quick flips have a negative connotation to me.

So I started it with a bit of skepticism.  But this quickly disappeared as I got into the story.  Built To Sell is told in a parable format (somewhat like Rich Dad, Poor Dad or The E-Myth Revealed) which made it really easy to read and very engaging.  I finished it within 24 hours.

The book goes through the story of Alex, a small business owner who decides he wants to sell his company one day and realizes he can't because he has built a service business that is dependent on him.

Luckily he has a mentor named Ted, who takes him through the process of converting his company to one that can be sold.  This is based on mentors the author has had in real life, and it was clear from reading it that he has walked the walk.

It covers a bit of accounting, negotiation, business brokers, cash flow, etc.  I guess I left with the feeling that this kind of information could only have come from long meetings with lots of real mentors.  These are the kind of mistakes I wouldn't want to have to learn the hard way.

Check it out if you get a chance.  After reading it, I mailed it to a friend of mine in Houston who runs a service business.  It was the kind of information I wanted to [share](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0986480304?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0986480304).
