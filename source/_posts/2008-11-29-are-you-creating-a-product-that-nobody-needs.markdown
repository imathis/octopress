The easiest products to sell are those that solve a BURNING desire.  What do people lay awake at night thinking and dreaming about?  What do they have an intense fear or irrational fantasy about?

The three most popular are probably these:




	
  * **Health** If you can barely get out of bed, have an intense headache, or worse yet...have several months to live, what amount of money WOULDN'T you be willing to give to make it go away?

	
  * **Wealth** Everyone has irrational fears and fantasies regarding money.  It keeps us up at night.

	
  * **Relationships** Everyone has a strong desire to be loved.



A lot of first time entrepreneurs make the mistake of creating a product that people don't DESPERATELY need.  They create something that they think is cool, but no one else even knows to look for.

Maybe it's a book about their life story.  Maybe they want to become a fashion consultant.  Maybe it's a dog grooming service.

Nobody lays awake at night thinking "GOSH if only I could find a better dog groomer my life would be better!!".  No, they are thinking about how they can be skinnier, richer, and get the cute guy/gal at work to notice them.

Even if people do spend money occasionally on non-essential products and services, these are the first expenses they cut when money gets tight or the economy goes down.

Of course health, wealth, and relationships aren't the only ones.  People have incredibly strong emotions regarding their children, politics, sports, sex, etc.  These strong emotional reactions are what you're looking for because they cause people to buy (it's not as much logic as we'd like to think).

Whenever possible, it's better to check whether people actually want the product BEFORE creating it.

**How to know if anyone is looking for what you're selling:**

A quick way to check is with the [Google Adwords Keyword Tool](https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal).

In just a few seconds you can find out that 300,000 people each month search for dog grooming services.  But this pales into comparison to the 1.4 million searches each month for tutoring.  That in turn is outpaced by the number of people searching for help with back pain at well over 2 million.

You'll have an easier time if you pick a market where people are already desperately searching for a solution to their problem!  It's much harder to create something that no one knows about, and later try to convince them that they need it.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
