I was watching [this video](https://www.openforum.com/idea-hub/topics/marketing/video/made-to-stick-how-to-stand-out-in-a-crowded-marketplace?) today about how to stand out in your market place.  It gives some good examples of companies (like VooDoo Donut and ZipCar) who created a strong following by:

1. Doing something different
2. Having fun
3. Not being afraid to be a little weird

It reminded me of Google's "I'm feeling lucky" button or Facebook's [Pirate](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/19/once-again-facebook-owns-talk-like-a-pirate-day-on-the-web/) language setting.

It also reminded me of some of the ideas I wrote about in [word of mouth marketing](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-generate-word-of-mouth-for-your-business/).

**Then I started looking at the **[**BuyersVote.com**](http://BuyersVote.com)** homepage and I got sort of sad.  It looked really boring.**

It looked like every other review site out there.  If I saw it for the first time, I'd probably be sort of confused, do a few clicks, and then leave.

So I started wondering, what is this website actually ABOUT damnit.  It's got to convey it instantly.  And I blurted out "it just so you can find out if something sucks or not before you buy it!"

So I decided to change the tag-line of the site from "Online product reviews made easy" to "Find out if it sucks, before you buy!"

Irreverent?  Yes.  Junevile?  Probably.  Fun and engaging?  I think so.  At least it would cause me to give it a second look, and maybe even participate in this community - it's sounds fun.

What do you think?  Worst idea ever or good marketing?  I think I'll test it out for a bit.

**P.S. Because it worked out so well **[**last time**](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/300-increase-in-traffic-to-buyersvote-com-last-month/)**, I've started a new category on BuyersVote for "**[**Best Christmas Gift Ideas 2009**](http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-christmas-gift-ideas-2009-reviews)**".  Hopefully you'll find it useful as you do your last minute Christmas shopping.  Please take a moment to go **[**check it out now**](http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-christmas-gift-ideas-2009-reviews)** - and don't forget to vote or add your own idea if you have a good one.  Thanks!**

Until next time, keep breaking free!
