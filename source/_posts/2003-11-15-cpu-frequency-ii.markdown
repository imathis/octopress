<a href="http://www.zanshin.net/blogs/000296.html" title="cpu frequency">Previously</a> in this space I wrote about discovering that the Mac OS X 10.2.8 upgrade reset the value used for CPU frequency. In my case I lost about a 3rd of my overall speed.

By reseting the PMU I was able to get full horsepower again.

For a while.

It seems that rebooting the machine loses the correct PMU value. Nuts. So now, until I upgrade to Panther (maybe soon now) I have to reset the PMU every time I restart or reboot my Powerbook.

Panther here I come.
