Here is a great list of new startups that just came out from the [Y-Combinator Demo Day](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/silicon-valley-elite-flock-to-y-combinator-demo-day/).  Definitely worth checking out.  It looks better than normal and there is some amazing work being done there.

One thing that struck me from seeing this list: Web 2.0 entrepreneurs tend to forget that you don't actually have a business unless people are willing to part with their hard earned cash to use what you built.  For example, FlightCaster, JobSpice, Bump Technologies, Listia....amazing sites, but I can't see anyone actually paying money to use these.  If that's the case then it's not a company, it's a project.  Call it what it is.

RentHop.com and HighlightCam.com I can see people paying for.  Why isn't RentHop charging anything?  This idea that you can reach critical mass by going free and then suddenly switch to a paid model has been largely shown not to work - it just upsets your base who feel like you've sold out.  If you're going to charge for it, you need to do it from day one.  If you aren't, then don't call it a business - it's a charity project where you hope to maybe break even on ad revenue. (Personally, I think RentHop should charge a small listing fee...it's well worth it and I'd love to see them be successful and expand to other cities.)

RethinkDB.com also looks brilliant, but might work better as an open source product and not a company.  They're going to have a big mental hurdle to clear to get people to pay for it when MySQL is free and always has been.

But overall I'm very impressed and you should take a minute to [check out all the companies in the article](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/silicon-valley-elite-flock-to-y-combinator-demo-day/).
