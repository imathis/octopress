Some of you have noticed and emailed me about the "Top Commentators" section in the right hand sidebar of this website.

This is a list of people who have posted comments on the site, and as a bonus for commenting it gives the top 5 posters a link to their website (based on number of posts).  This link shows up on several hundred pages of this site including the Page Rank 4 homepage.

Its a great way to build traffic and ranking in search engines for your website.

Of course, you can also just email me a thoughtful relevant question that you really would like to know the answer to, and if I post the reply I'll include a link to your site.

What ONE THING are you really dying to know, that would help you get a business started, quit your job, or get you on your way to financial freedom?
