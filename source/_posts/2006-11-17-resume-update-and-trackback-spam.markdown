I've updated my resume page, and I've cleaned up some trackback spam from some of the older links.

Keeping ahead of the trackback spam is particularly annoying. My email spam filter grabs the notifications of new trackbacks and throws them in the spam folder <em>when the trackback itself tastes like spam</em>. Since there are some 700 new messages in that folder every day I rarely cull through it looking for false positives. So trackback spam can go unnoticed for several days. I've switched the notification email address to my Gmail account, hopefully I'll see them sooner that way.
