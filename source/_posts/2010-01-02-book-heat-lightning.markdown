John Sandford's <em>Heat Lightning</em> is the second book with the central character Virgil Flowers. Â Virgil works for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for Lucas Davenport, the central character of all the <em>Prey</em> books. The first Virgil Flowers book, <em>Dark of the Moon</em>, was a little slow getting started but a good read. This second story was very good.
