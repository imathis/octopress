![steps.jpg](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/05/steps1.jpg)I’m going to share with you here the process that almost every successful entrepreneur went through to getting their business started – condensed into just four basic steps.

I’ve become convinced that entrepreneurship is quite simply one of the best things you can do for yourself – assuming you do it the right way (by following the steps below).

Those who become successful business owners end up having total freedom in their life, improved health, better relationships, and more money.  I don’t even remember what rush hour traffic feels like, and I work in my underwear some days if I feel like it!

I don’t claim that it is easy to build a successful life as an entrepreneur, but is certainly possible for anyone who wants it badly enough.

These four steps as essential, and if you REALLY do them...your probability for success as an entrepreneur is quite high.  If you can’t even do these four, then you quite simple aren’t serious about becoming a successful business owner.

Without further ado, here are the four time tested steps to starting a successful business.  This also serves as a guide for how you should use this website:


### STEP 1 – Decide What You Want


You think you know what you want, but have you ever taken the time to actually write it down?  Don’t feel bad, ninety-nine percent of people never have.  If you don’t know what you want...the chances of you happening to STUMBLE upon it one day are slim to none.

Three important points to remember about writing it down: (1) make sure it is measurable, (2) give it a deadline, and (3) write down some compelling reasons WHY you must get it.  If you had to earn $1 Million next year to save your child’s life, I bet you would find a way to do it!  If you don’t really want it, then you will never be a successful entrepreneur.


### STEP 2 – Learn Every Day


You need to start soaking up new information like a thirsty sponge.  The problem is that you’ve been flooded with incorrect messages from the day you were born.  Messages about money, risk, how to start a business, and quite frankly WHAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF.

You are going to need a completely different mindset to start THINKING like a successful entrepreneur.  Your beliefs are going to have to change.  The only way I know of to do that is slowly over time by putting tons of positive new stuff into your head.

You are going to have to start reading a ton of books and articles, meeting other people, discussing with them, and getting your hands on every entrepreneurship resource you can find.

My book is just one such resource and there are plenty of other good ones.

It’s nice to say “Ok I will start reading more”, but here are three ways to make sure it happens by automatically increasing the amount of learning you get done: (1) listen to audio programs and books on tape in your car or during your commute (you have to drive anyway, so the books will automatically get read, this is HUGE) and (2) learn how to speed read (yes it really works).


### STEP 3 – Emulate the Best


Want to know how smart people mess up starting a business?  They are so smart that they think they can do it their own way!  Big mistake....the best way to get success is to look at people who already have it and do what they do.

What this means is that you need a new group of friends.  You need to get rid of all those people in your life who are unmotivated, belittle your ambitions, and complain about their crappy jobs even though they will never leave!

You also need to get at least one really good mentor who you meet with regularly.  How should you meet all these new people?  You need to start becoming a master networker and quite simply, you can't be afraid to ask for help.  You might be surprised how willing people are to help if you simply ask.


### STEP 4 – Take Action, Over and Over Again


Are you a thinker or a doer?  You’ve probably met some thinkers in your day.  They love to discuss ideas all day, hold lots of meetings where nothing gets done, and have plenty of good ideas.  They can be wonderful people, but unfortunately they will never be successful entrepreneurs.

The best idea in the world isn’t worth a dime in the hands of a thinker.  Successful entrepreneurs are DOERS who study time management, work off written to-do lists, and get excited about results.

If you’re not a doer, there is good news.  You can become one.  It’s also easy to get lots of work done when you really love the business you start.

Reading and learning (step 2) are great but if you just keep doing that forever, waiting for the right time, then you aren’t an entrepreneur.  Actually taking action is scary, but you’ll never be entirely ready and will have to act ANYWAY.  Entrepreneurs, act in spite of fear and follow the philosophy of ready, fire, aim.

Finally, as you’re taking action...you are going to fail.  A lot.  You could fail 100 times before you get your first success, but you know what?  That is GREAT!  Every time you fail you will learn a valuable lesson.  Failing early and often (and small) is actually a REQUIRED step to becoming a successful entrepreneur.
