The family of web sites that I maintain have been updated with Jay Allen's excellent <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/" title="MT-Blacklist">MT-Blacklist</a> plugin. While I haven't suffered from the flood of comment spam other sites have dealt with, I am getting more and more junk in my blogs comments. Now I can spend my time on other things besides deleting spam from my comments.
