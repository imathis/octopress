After almost three weeks of unemployment, uncertainty, and fear about the future, we got some good news yesterday. One of the companies that Michele had applied to responded with a request for a phone interview.

Together we have responded to dozens of openings in three major markets and until yesterday we had heard nothing in return. It was disheartening to say the least. In my case I've sent out nearly 75 resumes to companies large and small in Raleigh, Tampa, and Chicago. In many of these cases the position requirements read like my resume, as if the job was tailor made for me. Getting no replies whatsoever was starting to really scare me. How could I not get any responses?

Metaphysically I understand that each lifetime is about gaining knowledge through experience. That we determine the lessons we need before starting the life, and if an anticipated direction or opportunity isn't happening it just means it isn't part of the lesson. In other words, the only reason for me not to have heard from all these contacts I've made is that none of them is the right next step for me. Easy to understand and accept in the abstract, very difficult to live with in reality.

So Michele's good news is a ray of sunshine in an otherwise dark and gloomy landscape. We are trying very hard not to put too much pressure on this single event, or anticipate a future beyond it. Instead we are happy to have confirmation that there is a future, and that our patience with ourselves is starting to pay off.
