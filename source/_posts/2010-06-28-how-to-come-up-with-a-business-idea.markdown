Here are a collection of questions you can answer to come up with business ideas.  These are taken from Paul Graham's excellent [article](http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html) on the subject which is worth reading if you have the time.

Sit down with a cup of coffee and force yourself to write out 10 answers to each of these questions.  Even if you think they are silly, force yourself to write 10.  You'll be off to a good start.



	
  * What do I find intolerable?

	
  * What luxury can I turn into a commodity?

	
  * What big companies solution could I make easier to use?

	
  * What will kids in 10 years look back on and not believe about how difficult our lives were?
