Michele and I had a wonderful weekend. Little of any consequence was accomplished except for rest, relaxation and fun. We swam and napped, cooked in and ate out.

The breakthrough about my needing to write more to maintain my sanity was important. I have written two new postings that helped me a great deal. I plan to post more as a result.

As we wind down and head into the closing hours of this weekend I am feeling rested for the first time in weeks. It's a good feeling.
