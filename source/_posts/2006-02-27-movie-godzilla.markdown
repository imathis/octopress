Okay, so <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0120685/" title="Godzilla">Godzilla</a> is a bit campy, entirely predictable, and left wide open for a sequel; it's still a fun movie ride. Matthew Broderick's off-beat everyman comedy is a perfect foil to the larger than life monster.

Rating: "<a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/GODZILLA-lyrics-Blue-Oyster-Cult/439EC33DBF214DC848256A1000088535" title="Blue Oyster Cult - Godzilla lyrics">Oh no, there goes Tokyo!</a>"
