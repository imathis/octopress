[![GoDaddy Domain Registration Extend](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/godaddy11-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/godaddy11.png)This is day 12 of my 30 day [marketing challenge](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/) to demonstrate blogging can be a profitable business to start.

My three tasks for the day were...

1. [Yesterday](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-11-article-for-probloggernet-stumbleupon-campaign-and-longer-domain-registration-attempt/) I couldn't get my web host to extend my domain registration.  But based on a [comment](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-11-article-for-probloggernet-stumbleupon-campaign-and-longer-domain-registration-attempt/#comments) by a reader, I accomplished this through GoDaddy.com today.  My domain is now registered for 9 years.  Thanks!



2. Sent out 10 more link exchange requests through [LinkMachine](http://www.linkmachine.net/trk.php?ID=2328).

3. Did another search on [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) for related blogs and submitted an article to [Startup Spark](http://startupspark.com/) and [Tyler Cruz's Blog](http://www.tylercruz.com/).

My Stumble Upon advertising is almost done ($4 of my original $50 budget is left).  I will report tomorrow on how effective it was and the feedback I got from Stumble Upon viewers.
