I've had a <a href="http://flickr.com" title="Flickr">Flickr</a> account for some time now, and occasionally upload a picture or three there. Thanks to the generosity of a very special someone ( ;) ) I now have a pro account and can upload 2GB a month.

This means that nearly all of the pictures I took this past week in Oregon and northern California are available for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/zanshin/" title="my Flickr photos">viewing</a> online.

Enjoy.
