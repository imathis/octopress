[Derek Sivers discusses](http://sivers.org/nolimit) the exact [point I made](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/helping-individual-people-cant-make-you-rich/) a few weeks ago (with a much better example than mine)



> If you sell pens for a living and someone orders a million pens, no problem! You just place an order with your manufacturer for a million pens, get them to the customer, and celebrate.

But if you do hands-on massage for a living and a recent spot on Oprah gets you a waiting list of 10,000 people, “you’ll wish you were in the pen business.”




[This is Why MLM and Network Marketing Don't Work](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/913-question-your-work) - ask yourself these before getting too far into a new business idea



> Why are we doing this?  
What problem are we solving?  
Is this actually useful?  
Are we adding value?

> I'm sure that the moment man discovered fire, there was some guy nearby saying, "Too smoky. Can burn you. Lame."



[Scott Adams at the Dilbert Blog Forgets the Best Option: Self Employment and Passive Income Streams](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2008/04/time-management.html)



> Sleep: 8 hours
Exercise: 1 hour
Work: 8 hours
Eating: 2 hours (leisurely)
Hygiene: 1 hour
Travel: 1 (Commute, errands)

That leaves you three hours for family time, sex, shopping, food preparation, chores, household repair, volunteering in the school, and so on. If you have a dentist appointment, or your talkative relative calls, or American Idol has a two-hour special, you’re tapped out.



[37 Signals Celebrates People Who Quit Their Jobs](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/979-quit-your-job)


> Five little companies were featured to showcase the owner’s decision to leave their daily rat dace of a life behind and dive into the uncertainty of following their dreams. Here’s the kicker: These 5 companies are some of the most mundane, normal, average little companies out there.

These companies aren’t going to beat Google, they aren’t building a better iPod or bread slicer. There’s no “the next Facebook” and not a mention of angel funding. These entrepreneurs are doing simple things they love and making a pretty decent living from it.
