A few days ago I wrote about how you can [get a business website built for cheap or free](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-get-a-business-website-built-for-cheap-or-free/).  Several people (correctly) pointed out that you often get what you pay for in these type of situations.

They are absolutely right about that.  If you go the inexpensive/free route you can easily get bogged down in mysterious wordpress errors as you try to hack plugins together, or deal with incompetent contractors abroad.

If you are on a budget, then that is the way to go, but it doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be easy.

(Note: In my own experience, about 1 in 5 contractors that I use through sites like eLance.com and Guru.com are really good.  So my solution is to give them a small project up front to evaluate them before deciding who to work with.  It only costs a few bucks each.)

But if you have a little bit of money to spend (and we're still talking relatively small amounts here - hundreds, not thousands) you can often get a really great design done for you without the hassle.

One site I've seen recently who is doing a great job is [CrowdSpring.com](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/crowdspring).  What's unique about this is that designers don't just BID on your project, they actually SUBMIT a preliminary design as their bid.  This is really cool because it allows you to pick from a whole bunch of designers before deciding who to pay.

Right now they only do graphic design, and not programming, but it's a good start.

Incidentally, [CrowdSpring](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/crowdspring) is a good example of a passive income business.  They are also doing a percentage based business model similar to what I am [contemplating](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/new-features-and-tests-on-my-passive-income-business/) for UniversityTutor.com, where they take a percentage of each booking.

Very impressive site...[check them out](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/crowdspring) for your next design project.
