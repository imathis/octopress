The theater nearest to where I live has very early matinees on the weekends. The first showing is usually around 11:00 am. As a bonus the admission price to this early show is only $4.50, two dollars less than the usual admittance price. However, that isn't the best part.

The best part comes from living in a very religious community. Church attendance is high in these parts which means the pool of people going to see movies first thing Sunday morning is small. The last several movies I've seen at the 11:00 am showing have been deserted, even the new releases are under populated. At MI:III and The Sentinel I only had to share the theater with a total of seven other people. That's for <b>both</b> movies combined.

I'm off to see Poseidon by myself this morning.
