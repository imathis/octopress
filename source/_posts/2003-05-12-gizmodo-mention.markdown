I'm somebody now!

One of my favorite daily sites is <a href="http://gizmodo.com/" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a>. Yesterday I discovered a site with some wonderfully looking storage solutions, and wanting to share, I passed the site URL on to Gizmodo. <a href="http://gizmodo.net/archives/002001.php#002001" target="_blank">This</a> link is another few seconds off my 15 minutes of fame.
