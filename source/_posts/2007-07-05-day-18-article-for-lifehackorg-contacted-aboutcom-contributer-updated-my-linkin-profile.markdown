[![LinkedIn Professional Network and Place To Talk About Your Business](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/linkedin53721-150x58.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/linkedin53721.png)This is day 18 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new readers to this blog, and demonstrate that blogging can be a [profitable and inexpensive business to start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

By the way, one non-marketing thing that I did today was open a separate business account for this website at Washington Mutual (they have great free business checking accounts).  This will help me track all my income and expenses from this blog.  This is something I recommend all entrepreneurs do when starting a new project.  Just using the debit card for your business account will automatically track all your business expenses for tax time (so you can deduct them!).

1. I wrote a new article for LifeHack.org.  I'll post a link when it comes out in a few days.



2. I contacted Scott Allen at [About.com's Entrepreneur Section](http://entrepreneurs.about.com) to see if there was an opportunity to work together.  His [interview style](http://entrepreneurs.about.com/b/a/216405.htm) is refreshing.

3. I put Breaking Free and StartBreakingFree.com on my [linked in](http://www.linkedin.com/in/barmstrong) profile.
