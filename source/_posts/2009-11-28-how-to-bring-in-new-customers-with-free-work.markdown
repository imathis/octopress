Here is a question from a Breaking Free reader....


> Dear Brian,

Your book inspired me to start up my own business based on your Start Breaking Free model.

I was a lawyer working 80 hour weeks at an international firm, doomed to spending the best years of my life behind a desk. I was depressed and my confidence was taking a battering from my unhappy, over critical, negative, unhealthy and institutionalized colleagues.

After reading your book I started to ponder how, if at all, I could escape the rat race.

My answer came a few short weeks after reading your book. If I was working 80 hours a week and making less than a third of my billing target, where was the rest of the money going? After weeks of research I found out that it was going to a combination of a) the under worked over paid partners b) the lazy and inefficient staff and c) the office, stationary, IT and other such expenses.

I decided to setup a service that has none of these expenses and that offers lawyers a better life and businesses a cheaper more efficient service. I set up Matrix Law Group which places lawyers with businesses on a temporary employee basis and which allows those lawyers to work either remotely or from the business' office (so no office).

I advertise in a few small business publications over here and then hire someone, including myself out (like a temp agency) and charge businesses a low hourly rate (we have no overheads so can undercut traditional law firms). I now work about about 7 to 10 hours a week at £100 an hour and because of more favourable tax treatments, I make a decent wage but a less than I did when I was working 80 hours a week. But guess what? I am much much happier and healthier.

I won't lie, getting business is not easy, specially since I have to do all my marketing myself.

My question to you is whether you can offer me any advice on marketing myself and my business? My website is [www.matrixlawgroup.com](http://www.matrixlawgroup.com), other than that, and a few adverts, I have no other marketing tools. Law is one of those industries that works on a word of mouth basis. I am therefore trying to approach people, such as yourself, to get advice.

Thank you for inspiring me to change my life.

Keep breaking free.
Patrick

Hey Patrick,

Wow I love it!  I think it's a great idea and will save people lots of money (the perfect sales pitch at this time).

I'm not sure if you designed the site like this intentionally, but it came across somewhat web 2.0 ish or futuristic.  At least for me I'd prefer to see something more professional and old fashioned looking for a legal site, that instills a sense of quality.  Up to you of course, just thought I'd mention it.  Did you think about listing the available lawyers on the site as well with some sort of profile?

Anyway, I think you're off to a great start. I actually thought about doing something similar a while back (the UniversityTutor of lawyers sort of thing) but decided to focus just on tutors right now.  As for marketing, a couple things come to mind...start blogging, put in the title long tail keywords which you may rank for easier at first (less competitive).  Make blog posts naming specific companies and how they could improve their legal costs.  By calling them out publicly you can get some attention/controversy.  Maybe even make outrageous challenges...for example, you can publicly offer to complete some legal task for free for someone, just to prove how much lower your costs (number of hours) would have been, and then show the work for people to compare quality.

Overall, I think giving away your services for free at first could be great marketing.  Basically...



	
  1. get in touch with some business

	
  2. ask them what their current legal fees are costing them

	
  3. if it's a good fit, offer to do the work they were paying these other guys for for FREE for a month

	
  4. after that if they aren't happy with the results then you part ways, if they are happy then they can consider hiring you at your agreed upon rate (highly likely to happen if you work is good)


**Some people call this risk reversal - essentially removing 100% of the risk for someone to try you out so you can prove the benefit to them.  Charlie Hoehn's book, **[**Free Work**](http://www.slideshare.net/choehn/recessionproof-graduate-1722966)**, makes a great case for this.**

UPDATE: this [Mixergy interview with Neil Patel](http://mixergy.com/online-promotion/) has some great examples of how free work brought in new business.  Neil says "don't charge celebs or high profile people, take publicity/contacts instead of payment".

This is just to get started...once you have some regular customers, the referrals will start coming in.  Good luck!

This is just to get started...once you have some regular customers, the referrals will start coming in!  Anyway, I think I'll make a blog post out of this since I think others might find it useful.  May send you some traffic too.  Is it ok if I post your name and body of the email you sent me?  Thanks!




Thank you,
