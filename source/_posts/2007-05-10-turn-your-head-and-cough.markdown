Today I had my first physical in perhaps a dozen years.  There are several dynamics at work here, not the least of which is a desire to keep my health for as long as possible.  You see, when I was sixteen and the United States celebrated its Bicentennial I decided that I wanted to be alive to see the Tricentennial.  I'll be 116 then, and I'd like my body to be as fit and as healthy as possible.

Finding a new doctor is an interesting experience.  This is a person you will be sharing intimate details of your person with, and if you happen to select a doctor with whom you can't openly discuss bodily functions (or the lack thereof) you need to start over again.  My insurance provider has a cumbersome to use but ultimately useful physician locator on their website.  With a list of internists in hand I tried to figure out which to see.  Finally I just settled for the first one alphabetically.

Dr. B was very approachable and easy to talk with; she didn't talk down to us and I feel she listened to my concerns and addressed them.  While the exam was perhaps a bit perfunctory (I didn't actually turn my head and cough) I feel good about the visit.  I should get the results of a back x-ray and blood work back early next week.  I've also got a recommendation for a dermatologist as there is a history of skin melanoma in my family and I have some candidate moles.

In keeping with my new found desire to become active in my health once again I have a dentist appointment next week.  Expect the posting following that visit to be one long "Gaaaaaah!" sound.
