<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074340629X/qid=1143427562/sr=2-3/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_3/103-1777557-8386232?s=books&v=glance&n=283155" title="Last Light">Last Light</a> is compelling if not very good literature. Written by a former British Special Services (SAS) veteran, it is gritty and uncompromising in the very unglamorous life of a special operations agent.

Rating: I read it only because I'd read the earlier ones
