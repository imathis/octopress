Over the course of the past 12 months I managed to read a total of eight-five books. I'm not sure what this says about me other than I am a voracious reader. I don't know if I will keep score again this year or not, but it is tempting.

Using Amazon and their affiliate link program has netted me exactly no money, either no one visits me book page or if they do, they aren't into the same books as me.

Maybe I should go back to putting the books on the main page as individual postings instead of burying them off on another page. But that would necessitate a redesign of the whole site I order to be aesthetically pleasing to me, so I don't expect it will happen any time soon.
