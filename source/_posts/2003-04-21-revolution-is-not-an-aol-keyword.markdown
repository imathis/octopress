I saw a link to <a href="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/biplog/archive/000748.html" target="_blank">Revolution is Not an AOL Keyword</a> over on <a href="http://slashdot.org/" target="_blank">slashdot</a> this morning. While I wasn't familiar with the original, <a href="http://www.gilscottheron.com/lyrevol.html" target="_blank">"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,"</a> I found this to be very good and worth reading. Read it out loud.
