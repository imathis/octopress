Sometimes people ask me questions like:
**Why take the risk of quitting your job?**

I was just [listening](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-education-how-to-devour-at-least-one-business-book-per-week-without-taking-any-additional-time-out-of-your-day/) to Brian Tracy speak in [The Psychology of Achievement](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPsychology-Achievement-Develop-Achievers-Mindset%2Fdp%2F0743526589%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1195613270%26sr%3D11-1&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325), and he phrases it better than I could have:



> Every single peak performing human being, every single high achieving man or woman, has been a person who has thrown off the natural tendency to play it safe and stay within the comfort zone, and has continually tried to exceed their previous levels of accomplishment, has continually  moved forward into the risk zone, to try something more and bigger and better and more important.  Every single accomplishment in the history of man, has come from men and women who have had the courage to take the risks, to step out even though they had no guarantee or assurance of success.

Make a quick list of people who really changed the world, helped others, and were wildly successful.  Did they have a 9-to-5 corporate job?

I also love what Brian Tracy has to say about failure.  Most people don't try, and those that do give up after the first or second time.




> In studying the lives and stories of the most outstanding men and women of all of history, we find that every single one of them has been a great failure.  People do not understand the importance of failure in achievement.  The fact is that it is impossible to succeed without failing, that failure is an indispensable prerequisite for success, and that all great success is proceeded by great failure...Every single person who has tried to accomplish something outside the ordinary has suffered setback and obstacle and defeat and adversity and disappointment and heartache over and over again as they have moved toward their goal.  There is no record of anybody ever having achieved any kind of success without having failed over and over again.  The only difference is that the winners continually pick themselves up and carry on knowing that ultimate success is inevitable as long as they keep on going on...your persistence is your measure of your belief in yourself.



Brian Tracy is awesome.
