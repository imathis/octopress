One of the many debates approaching near religious zeal in the Apple camp revolves around the continued one-button form factor Apple uses for their mice and track-pads. In order to access right-click menus or functions one must utilize the "CTRL" key or use a third-party mouse.

<a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/" title="Powerbook Refresh">Today's</a> PowerBook refresh, while adding slight processor upgrades, Bluetooth 2.0, and a high base memory configuration, adds scrolling via the track-pad.
<p class="quote"> "Scrolling through web pages or large documents on a trackpad can challenge even the most nimble fingers. That's why every PowerBook G4 features a new trackpad with scrolling capability. Just drag two fingers over the trackpad to scroll vertically and horizontally or pan around any active window. Change this feature to suit your needs: Customize your trackpad settings or turn off scrolling completely via System Preferences."</p>
While this is certainly an innovative way to address scrolling via track-pad, it still falls short of acknowledging that the typical UI today is filled with opportunities to use a outer mouse button, instead of an awkward two-handed keyboard and mouse gesture.
