For the last year, maybe year and a half, I have tossed my pocket change into an old tupperware bin in the kitchen junk drawer.  The bin finally filled to where coins were falling out of it into the drawer itself.  And the drawer was getting harder to work as the weight of the coins was causing it to bind in its tracks a bit.

So today I took them all to the credit union and made a little deposit.  Before going however, I stood on the bathroom scale and weighed the coins.  13.6 pounds of them.  In all I have 1682 coins: 755 pennies, 180 nickels, 326 dimes, and 421 quarters, for a total of $154.40.

A nice little bonus this month.
