This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000687M48/sr=8-1/qid=1152188937/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0631788-6727951?ie=UTF8" title="Anywhere But Home">live DVD</a>, shot in Paris, following the debut <i>Fallen</i> album, is muscular, energetic, and aurally very satisfying. Where it slips a bit is visually. Unfortunately the director felt that split-second shots of the band from strange angles, in a  montage with crowd scenes, makes a better video than a straight ahead look from say five rows out in the crowd.

Rating: Play it LOUD
