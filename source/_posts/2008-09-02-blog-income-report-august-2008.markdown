Some people have been asking me how much money this blog makes.

If you've been reading it for a while then you know I like making [monthly financial statements](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-and-create-a-personal-financial-statement-each-month-in-5-minutes/), so as you might have guessed I track the numbers.

Here they are for August 2008.

**Income:**



	
  * $215.00 - [Book Sales](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/)

	
  * $87.70 - [Google Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)

	
  * $53.00 - [Private Ad Sales](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/advertise/)

	
  * $50.14 - [Text Link Ads](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/tla)

	
  * $10.22 - [Kontera](http://www.kontera.com)

	
  * $3.50 - [Commission Junction](http://www.cj.com)

	
  * $1.36 - [Chitika](http://chitika.com/mm_overview.php?refid=barmstrong)


TOTAL INCOME: $420.92

**Expenses:**



	
  * $10.00 - Hosting with [1and1](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/1and1) (this includes a number of sites, not just BreakingFree)

	
  * $45.00 - Book printing and shipping costs (paperback only)

	
  * $5.00 - [E-Junkie](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/e-junkie) for processing book payments


TOTAL EXPENSES: $60.00

**NET INCOME: $360.92**

As you can see I've been trying a variety of ad programs.  Some of them are under performing, like Kontera, CJ, and Chitika.  I'm always ready and willing to replace these with something that might work a lot better.  In particular the 125x125 square ads on the right side of this blog make very little money at all.  I was trying a company called PerformancingAds.com last month which brokers 125x125 square ads like that, but they didn't make a single dollar :(.  That space can probably be put to better use.

If anyone has other suggestion for what has made them money on their blog, please post below in the comments.

I don't think blogging is a good way to get rich quick, but if you enjoy writing about a subject then by all means it doesn't hurt to make some money on the side.

The real benefit of blogging (at least in my mind) is:



	
  1. Writing your thoughts and interacting with others on a particular topic forces you to learn it better and faster.

	
  2. From a purely egotistical point of view, it just feels good to help other people, get emails from them, and have people listen to what you say.

	
  3. It's like a personal journal to help you record and organize your thoughts.

	
  4. It's a good way to keep in touch with people who you wouldn't ordinarily have time to communicate with on a regular basis.  They can still know what's going on in your life.

	
  5. It builds distribution for your ideas (also known as a permission asset) so that the next time you launch a project there are people who know you and are willing to check it out.



If the non-monetary reasons make enough sense for you to blog, then I think you can wake up a few years later and have a nice fairly passive income.  It certainly doesn't happen quick though, and I've still got a ways to go.  I'll keep you posted as things progress and I find other ways to make money from blogging as a side income.
