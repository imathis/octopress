My father introduced me to the Kurt Wallander mysteries, and I have been slowly working my way through them all. <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/White-Lioness-Henning-Mankell/dp/1400031559/sr=8-1/qid=1166562636/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2598303-1862327?ie=UTF8&s=books" title="The White Lioness">The While Lioness</a></i> is the third of the series and the most ambitious so far. Moving from Sweden to South Africa and back again the book has an international intrigue flavor without losing the, all too human, viewpoint of the main character.

Rating: Excellent from start to finish
