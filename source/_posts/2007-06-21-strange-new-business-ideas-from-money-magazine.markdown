Sharon wrote in to tell me about this [article](http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/moneymag/0706/gallery.success_stories.moneymag/index.html) from Money Magazine that discusses 8 entrepreneurs and the businesses they started.

I couldn't help feeling a little strange after reading through.  Are these really good examples of companies one should start?  Some of them seemed like poor choices that spent way too much to get started.




	
  * Does the world need another smoothie shop?  I imagine you'd have much greater success starting a Jamba juice or Smoothie King franchise then trying to reinvent the wheel.

	
  * Why does it take $200k to start a board game company?  Couldn't you get prototypes made for a couple hundred dollars (at least enough to show at trade shows and get your first orders?)

	
  * The chances of succeeding when opening a chocolate shop seem slim.



Sandy Webster seems to be one of the few in the group who [bootstrapped](http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/moneymag/0706/gallery.success_stories.moneymag/4.html) correctly.

What this article demonstrates to me is that even if you take a mediocre business idea, you can still be successful if the owner is incredibly passionate.  Personally, I'd rather start with a less risky idea, but anything is possible!
