I came across an excellent three minute video the other day that wanted to share with you.  It comes from a man name Richard St. John, who interviewed 500 of the most successful people in the world and asked them how they got there.

It's really quite simple if you think about it.  When you want to improve, analyze the best and brightest, and look for common traits.

By the way, there are a number of excellent TED talks that you might want to [watch](http://www.ted.com/talks).
