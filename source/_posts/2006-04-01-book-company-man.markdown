This week I've been reading <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312939426/sr=8-1/qid=1143898390/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-1777557-8386232?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="Company Man">Company Man</a></i> by Joseph Finder. The plot has a nice twist to it  and over all the story was very satisfying. This books marks the first time I have been able to read in bed before going to sleep where I could focus on the text without my glasses. I'm not sure that made a good tale any batter but it did make it more fun for me.

Rating: Compelling and well-paced
