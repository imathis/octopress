I missed Jonathan Rauch's article <em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200303/rauch" title="Caring For Your Introvert">Caring For Your Introvert</a></em> article when it first came out, but thanks to <a href="http://kottke.org" title="Kottke">kottke.org</a> I was introduced to it today.

It perfectly describes Michele, and moreover, it describes me too. All my life I have tried to tell people I was shy only to have them object. Now I know that what I was describing as shy is really introversion. How perfect then, is this medium, where I can, to quote Kottke, "carry on a conversation with a whole group of people and stare down at my shoes at the same time."

Now, please go away and leave me alone.
