Recently, and quite by accident, I discovered what appeared to be a legitimate karate dojo just five minutes drive from my new office location. After conferring with a friend who had studied in the style himself, and learning that the association was well regarded, I decided to have a look.

The dojo facility is incredible, perhaps the nicest dojo I've seen. My tour left me impressed and so I made plans to return and try a workout or two or more. I've been rehabilitating a pulled groin injury and the lower back compensation injury for months now - my primary question was, "am I healthy enough to do this once again?"

After some scheduling delays, and some time screwing up my courage, I went for the first workout this past Tuesday at noon. It was very good. A surprising amount of what I had known intimately before came back from the recesses of my mind. The time passed quickly, and by the end of the workout I was pleasantly surprised to find I wasn't in pain. I know that my motivations for starting karate again are far different from what they were when I originally started in 1990. Whether my new motivation is drive enough for me to continue the path back towards black belt rank remains to be seen.
