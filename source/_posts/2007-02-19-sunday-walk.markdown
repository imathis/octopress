Our goal to walk more this year has not been overly successful. Still we are trying, and yesterday, with some much warmer weather to enjoy, we managed to walk about two and half miles. Just south of the Overland Park apartment there is a golf course, and wrapped around two sides of it a paved nature trail that the city maintains. The accumulated snow from the past few week was melting so parts of the path were covered in slush, other parts water. Despite having wet feet by the time we returned home, our walk was very enjoyable.
