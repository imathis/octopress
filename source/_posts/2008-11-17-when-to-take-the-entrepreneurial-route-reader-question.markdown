> Hi Brian,
I really enjoyed reading your articles! Thanks! What type of advice would you give for someone who is about to graduate college...go out into the workforce first to get "established?" Or take the entrepreneurial route from the beginning? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks so much.
Katie



Hi Katie,

I struggled with that too when I graduated.  Basically, I took the money and after college went to do consulting.  I only lasted there 3 months before I quit to work for myself.  But in a way I'm glad I did it, because at least I knew what I was missing by quitting.  If I had just gone right into entrepreneurship, then when the going got tough (and it will) I probably would have questioned my decision more.

I also had an insecurity I think that people would say "he became an entrepreneur because he COULDN'T get a job".  It sounds silly, but I think this was a fear that I had and I wanted to prove them wrong.

Your friends will probably be out driving fancy new cars, using company credit cards, and traveling for their jobs, etc.  This can be intimidating if you are just starting out in your own business and are feeling broke.  You'll start to second guess your decision.

The benefits of entrepreneurship might not be as obvious up front, but pay off in spades later.  For example, you haven't given up 40-80 hours of your life each week for another person's goals, you won't have to sacrifice health/sleep/freedom for a paycheck, and you can eventually end up much wealthier than your friends.

So I guess I'd say if you are on the fence, going to get a job for a while can be beneficial in the sense that it can reaffirm your belief about what you DON'T want to go back to.  This can be the motivation that helps you really get your own business going.  It can be the reason [why you must](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/why-i-must/).

Just don't get STUCK in that job by going out and spending the new money you're earning with big expenses like car payments and house payments.  You can just as easily become a slave to your job by having such high expenses that you CAN'T quit.  If you decide to, try setting a specific date in your mind when you will force yourself to quit.  This will help you prepare for the transition and encourage you to take action.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
