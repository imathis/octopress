The month of October saw a slight increase in the amount of spam I'm getting. For the month I had 6,312 spams, up from last month's 5009. My total for the year is now 64,023.

My average is now 6,402.3 per month and 210.6 per day. My new estimate for the year is 76,600. Wow.

Last month I talked about setting up a Linux server and using it as, among other things, a mail server. I haven't done anything towards this goal. I guess the daily pain of sifting through the junk filtered messages for false positives hasn't reached my breaking point.
