<p>On the night of three days ago, when I am in bed, I suddenly heard a strange sound, it came from my bed."There are some living things under my bed!"I thought. What are they?mice?insects?Oh, that was terrible!I quickly went to Mother's room, and asked her to catch it, but she said nothing and went on sleeping!<br />Yesterday when I was using my computer, the computer suddenly stopped working! As if there is a power cut!But the fan is still working!<br />After rebooting the computer, the system had no record!It was very strange, there should be a record, but in fact there was no record!<br />After a while, when I open a folder,  the window has no menus, no tools, no status!It was strange! I had no way to fix it, so I use the system reduction, luckily the menus, tools and status came back.<br />I thought perhaps there are some viruses, so yesterday I checked my computer and found no virus! Last night when I was in bed I could no sound!<br />Don't you think they are very strange?</p>
