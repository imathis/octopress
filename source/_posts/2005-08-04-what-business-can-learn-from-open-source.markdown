Originally I saw this article linked to from <a href="http://slashdot.org/" title="/.">Slashdot</a>; it's so good I wanted to link to it here as well. I especially liked this:

<cite>
Open source and blogging both work bottom-up: people make what they want, and the the best stuff prevails. Does this sound familiar? It's the principle of a market economy. Ironically, though open source and blogs are done for free, those worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all their talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like Communist states.

Go <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html" title="What Business Can Learn From Open Source">read</a> it yourself.
