Since Friday things have been a little crazy in Houston as we recover from the Hurricane.

Yet, even when I was without power and water, my business in other cities managed to hum along almost without incident.  That's pretty cool, and illustrates the power in passive businesses.  You can continue to have money deposited into your bank account even when the entire city shuts down.

Side Note: I did however get an email from Google Adsense saying they shut my account down for "click fraud" on this site.  That's why all the ads have disappeared.  I have no idea why they think there was click fraud, but I've filed an appeal.  We'll see what happens.  I'm pretty surprised, since most of my experiences with Google have been great up until this.

But back to the hurricane, I like to try and see the positive in every situation, and in reality the Hurricane was not that bad.  I tried to think of it as a vacation (or actually somewhat like camping given the lack of AC and canned food).  I got lots of reading done, bonded with people, and basically partied every night for 4 days.  Don't tell anyone, but I actually ran outside through the hurricane with a group of people in our underwear at about 4am, and then went to the hot tub (relax, there wasn't any debris flying at that time or anything like that).  It was one of those peak life experiences that you don't want to miss.

People always freak out in situations like this which always seemed like the wrong attitude to me.  As I've written about before, [people are really bad at estimating risk](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/why-youre-worse-than-you-think-at-estimating-risk/).  The hurricane really wasn't very dangerous at all.  You have to put things into perspective, and it only killed 6 people in all of Texas.  More people than that die every hour in traffic accidents in the U.S.  Same with heart disease.  Not to mention the thousands of people who die every day of starvation around the world.  Sure, the hurricane might have set some people back financially, but it was also a good reminder of what's really important in life.  People need to stop worrying so much and start enjoying life.

Anyway, here are some pictures I took during the last four days.  Enjoy!

**We played a LOT of board games with candles.  It was also about 85 degrees with 90% humidity the whole night.  I don't know how people lived in Houston before air conditioning.**
