From time to time I get in touch with various readers of this blog who are "Breaking Free" in their own way.

Please take a minute to check out their respective sites below and give them a look! It's always pays to get around like minded people and see what you can learn.



	
  * [Gordie Rogers](http://gordierogers.com/) is an entrepreneur living in Tianjin, China and has built various web businesses

	
  * [Andrew](http://www.lifemaven.net/) is just graduating and debating how to navigate corporate America vs. the world of entrepreneurship
