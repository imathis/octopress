For the last year or two I've been hosting this blog (and others) on 1and1 Hosting with a shared hosting plan. While it was very inexpensive (about $10 per mont) the performance has been seriously lacking lately.

On a regular basis I would come to the homepage, or try to log into the backend, only to find the entire site was down or unresponsive. So I haven't been very happy with 1and1.

It would usually come back up fairly quickly as 1and1 would reboot the server quite often, but it was frustrating and very slow to use. If I was getting frustrated using my own site, then I imagine many users as well.

So I finally bit the bullet and moved several blogs over to my hosting account on [SliceHost](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/slicehost/). My hosting plan with SliceHost is a virtual private server (VPS) which should offer better performance. I already had this account because I was using it to host UniversityTutor.com (Ruby On Rails apps require more than what a shared plan can offer), and the extra capacity should be enough to run StartBreakingFree.com and HomeworkHelpBlog.com along side it.

In case you didn't know, there are basically 3 tiers of web hosting you can get:



	
  * **Shared** - this is the cheapest and lowest performance, basically it means perhaps dozens (or more) websites are all running off the same web server

	
  * **VPS** - this the mid range both in price and performance and mimics a private server by running less than a dozen "virtual|" operating systems on one server. You get a private IP address, root access, and freedom to change whatever you want so there is more control.

	
  * **Private Server** - this is the most expensive and most performance. Also the most freedom - it's an entire webserver to yourself. It's just that someone else manages it to make sure it has electricity and reliable internet at all times.




So basically, I moved from a shared plan with 1and1 for about $10/month to a VPS with SliceHost for about $48/month. Except I was already paying the $48/month to host UniversityTutor.com so I will actually save a little bit by canceling 1and1.

[SliceHost's 512MB plan](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/slicehost/) is enough to host all my sites right now and I can't recommend these guys enough. I'll probably be doing all my hosting with them in the future. If you are a bit tech savvy their hosting is awesome, and they have really knowledgeable folks sitting in a chat room at all hours in case anything goes down.

With 1and1 you'd wait 48 hours to get an email back from their support team who obviously didn't speak English, and would just send you a template email response that wasn't helpful at all. SliceHost has people who actually know what they are doing sitting in the chat room at all hours.

Moving everything over was a big process with a lot of steps, so if you see anything broken or not working anymore, drop me a comment below. Thanks!
