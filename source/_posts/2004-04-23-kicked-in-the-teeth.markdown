Without going into all the details tonight, our trip to Chapel Hill was less than successful in terms of finding suitable employment for Michele. In terms of learning enough about the prospective employer to know that she really doesn't want to work for them.

On the trip home we talked about our situation and both of us were relived that I had an ace in the whole. An old friend had put in a good word for me and as a result I had a shot at a new contract.

Or so I thought.

This evening after getting home I received an e-mail saying that another candidate, one with prior experience at the client, had been selected. Coming on top of a exhausting trip that was disappointing this is a bitter pill to swallow.

I'm going to bed.
