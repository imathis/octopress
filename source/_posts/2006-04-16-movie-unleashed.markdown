<i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0342258/" title="Unleashed">Unleashed</a></i> is a rather startling little film about a young man who has been raised violently by a petty criminal, but who ultimately finds redemption and salvation in music. Co-staring Bob Hoskins, Morgan Freeman, and Jet Li, <i>Unleashed</i> was surprisingly good.

Rating: Worth a place in your Netflix queue
