I'm not sure if <i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0370032/" title="Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a></i> was ever a comic book, or if the director and producers of the movie wanted to give it that look and feel, but it definitely has a comic book feel. It is violent without being graphic, sexy with out being sensual, and oddly engaging for having almost no story and no real character development.

Rating: Wait to rent it on DVD
