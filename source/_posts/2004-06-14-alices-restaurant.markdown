In his seminal protest song, "Alice's Restaurant Massacre," Arlo Guthrie talks about getting fingerprinted, and having the results enshrined in a folder somewhere at the FBI.

Today I was fingerprinted as part of getting a security clearance for a new job. Since I'm not under arrest or anything I doubt my prints will be enshrined anywhere in particular. So I'll post them here for posterity.
