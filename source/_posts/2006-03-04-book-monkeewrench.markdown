<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/045121157X/sr=8-1/qid=1141484409/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-2955314-8712907?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="Monkeewrench">Monkeewrench</a></i>, by mother and daughter writing team P. J. Tracy, is an excellent thriller. Nicely paced, with good character development, and a good plot twist near the climax, this murder mystery delivers on all counts.

Rating: Worth staying up late to finish
