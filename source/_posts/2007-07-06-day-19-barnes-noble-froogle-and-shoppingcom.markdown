[![Alexa Comparison of Shopping Websites](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/alexa-traffic-shopping-sites1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/alexa-traffic-shopping-sites1.png)Today is day 19 of my 30 day challenge to bring more readers to this website, increase the number of RSS subscribers, and sell more books.  This is part of a live demonstration I'm doing to show that blogging can be a [profitable and inexpensive business that anyone can start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

My three tasks for the day were...

1. The [book finally appeared on Barnes & Noble's website](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?r=1&ean=9781430307877), but it doesn't look quite right yet.  I spent some time sending them higher resolution cover images (front & back) and some changes to the text.  It needs a little cleaning up before prime time.  It should also appear on Amazon.com relatively soon.



2. I added the book to [Froogle](http://www.google.com/base/a/1035208/D9298999708278065731), Googles product directory.  Strangely, the listing will only last for 30 days as a maximum.  I guess they expect retailers to continually list their products.

3. I added the book to [Shopping.com's directory](http://www.shopping.com/), which also feeds sites like [MySimon](http://www.mysimon.com).  Of the various shopping comparison sites, [Shopping.com seems to be the most popular](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=bizrate.com&site1=shopping.com&site2=mysimon.com&site3=pricegrabber.com&site4=&y=p&z=1&h=300&w=610&range=3m&size=Medium&url=gigglesugar.com).  This listing was not free, and costs $0.15 per click that they drive to this website.  I'm funding the account with $50 so it will drive 333 visitors, and I'll track how many end up buying.  To break even, 3 or 4 of those people (about 1%) will have to buy the book.
