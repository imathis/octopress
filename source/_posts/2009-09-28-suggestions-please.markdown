Like a lot of bloggers I tend to write erratically and about topics that are of interest to me. Sometimes my topics strike a chord with the blog reading public and I generate lots of page views and gain new regular readers. Toward that end I am experimenting with a suggestion service.

Click on the "Suggestions?" tab which is hopefully visibly at the bottom left of my site, and fill in the form with any topic that you'd like me to write about. I can't guarantee that I'll write about every suggestion I receive, but I will write about those that seem to be popular or that strike a chord with me.

For those of you who are interested, I'm using <a title="Skribit" href="http://skribit.com/">Skribit</a> to provide this suggestion service.
