Buying a new car still sucks.

In person negotiations at car dealerships feel out of date and are unpleasant for many consumers.  And websites aren't much better: while there are a plenty of good car _research_ websites, you can't actually complete the transaction online.

In fact, the state of the art in online car buying hasn't changed in 10 years: the ubiquitous "request a quote" form that asks you to enter a make, model, and zip code.

Many consumers don't realize that by filling out a "request a quote" form your contact information has been sold to about 5 different car dealers for $20 each, and you're about to start getting lots of spam emails (auto-generated offers at uncompetitive prices) and unwanted phone calls.  Those dealers are trained to try and get you in the dealership and won't give you their best offers online.



	
  * Where is the competition in this market?

	
  * Why can't you see how other consumers have rated a dealer before walking into a dealership?

	
  * Why can't you compare all your offers side-by-side in the same format?

	
  * Why is the final price you'll pay to get the car off the lot still so unclear?


The new start-up I [recently joined in California](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/im-moving-to-the-san-francisco-bay-area/) is solving this problem.  The company is [CarWoo.com](http://CarWoo.com) and we're making a better car buying process where **dealers compete for your business**.

Here is the new homepage (be sure to [check out the video for some more details](http://carwoo.com/)):

We just officially launched this morning after more than a year in private beta.

And we just completed an A-round raising $4.5M from some [outstanding investors](http://carwoo.com/investors).

And the [press](http://carwoo.com/press) is starting to roll in.  This is going to be an exciting day!   The whole team is camped out in a big house in Las Vegas where we are attending the Digital Dealer conference.  It's been really exciting to see this process from the ground up!

Until next time, keep breaking free!
