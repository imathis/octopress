It has been six days since Justin Timberlake ripped the snap-on portion of Janet Jackson's costume away exposing her breast and pierced nipple for all of one second on national television. It has been six days of innuendo, accusations, and the highest levels of hypocrisy.

Several thoughts occur:
<ul>
<li class="il">If Justin acted on his own, without prior consent or knowledge of Janet, why is she the focus on all the attention? If this were the case, America is once again attacking the victim rather than the offender.</li>
<li class="il">If Justin and Janet acted together, why is she the only one being raked over the coals? Again, the male-dominated society here would rather prosecute the woman and not all the people involved.</li>
<li class="il">The hypocrisy in all this is that we sell <em>everything</em> in this country with sex, primarily the female sex. Cars, under garments, food, et cetera, are all sold with varying degrees of titillation. In my opinion the degree of titillation, and sexual objectification of women, increase with the degree of machismo in the program. What could be more macho that the Superbowl? To chastise a woman for having her breast bared for <em>one second</em> by the act of another person during a program filled with soft porn advertising is indeed hypocrisy.</li>
</ul>
America needs to get a real life and get over itself. Nudity and sexual content fill the broadcast day of <em>every</em> television channel, commercial and otherwise. Let's just grow up and admit that we all have bodies, and that every body has sexual organs.
