[![The old Breaking Free website with landing page](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/oldsite1-150x150.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/oldsite1.gif)As you may have noticed, this website has moved to a new format: a blog!

The previous site was a newsletter with a standard opt in page to capture emails.  I never felt quite right about that site...it always seemed a bit too sales-letterish and dishonest.  The emails were at times intrusive...you continued to receive them whether you'd asked or not.

This worked fine in the past, but as I watch the net [evolve](http://www.blogwriteforceos.com/blogwrite/enewsletters_vs_blogs/index.html), I think consumers have started to get tired of that model.  When you've seen one landing page, you've seen them all.

I like the blog format because it helps build trust right away.  You can view others participating and see the real message up front.  You don't ask anything of the reader until you've delivered and earned their trust.  And blogs are focused primarily on educating (in other words whats in it for YOU the reader, as opposed to me the author).

It sure didn't hurt to see several marketing experts using blogs on their own sites, including [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) and [John Reese](http://income.com/blog/), both of who I'd recommend.

Of course blogs primarily use RSS instead of Email for subscriptions, but most people don't know what RSS is yet.  So for right now I've created a hybrid blog that still includes an email option.  I created it with WordPress, which I have been absolutely thrilled with as a platform.

I've got some exciting ideas for this blog that will be comes over the next weeks and months.  Stay tuned!
