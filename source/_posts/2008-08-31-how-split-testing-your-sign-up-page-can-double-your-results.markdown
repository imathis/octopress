I thought ya'll might find this interesting.  As you might know, I'm a big fan of split-testing.  This is a good example of why.

Here are two different sign-up pages I tested for my [Austin tutoring website](http://www.austin-tutor.com).

This one got a **30% conversion rate** (meaning 30% of people who came to the page filled out the form at the bottom and signed up).

[![Sales Letter One](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/slone1-150x150.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/slone1.gif)

This next one does all the "right things" taught in traditional copywriting (strong headline, testimonials, longer=better, strong call to action, etc) and did only half as well: a **14% conversion rate**.

[![Sales Letter Two](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/sltow4-150x150.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/sltow4.gif)[![Sales Letter Two Part 2](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/sltow21-150x150.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/08/sltow21.gif)

I'm not a professional copywriter, but when dealing with a reasonably educated audience I think any of these "sales letter" type pages that contain lots of hype can turn people off.  There are too many scams on the internet and sales letters set off people's "BS" detectors.  Sometimes simpler is better.

What do you think?
