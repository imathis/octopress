Earlier this week I downloaded the new Twitter client from <a title="{13bold}" href="http://13bold.com/">{13 Bold}</a> called <a title="Bluebird Twitter application" href="http://bluebirdapp.com">Bluebird</a>. While the client only runs on Mac OS X 10.5, meaning I only use it at work (my home machine are all 10.4.11 due to their aging G4 processors), I like the way it works. I especially like the theming capability that is built in.

Working from one of the provided themes, and using the <a title="PlasticCodeWrap theme for TextMate" href="http://wiki.macromates.com/Themes/UserSubmittedThemes">PlasticCodeWrap</a> theme for <a title="The Missing Editor for Mac OS X" href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> as an inspiration, I created a new theme called PlasticWrap for Bluebird. It sports a dark background, uses colors to distinguish between regular tweets, your tweets, and responses to your tweets. It also bumps up the size of the avatars displayed.

<a title="Download the PlasticWrap theme" href="http://zanshin.net/files/PlasticWrap.bbtheme.zip">Download</a> the ZIP archive, expand it, and copy the <strong>PlasticWrap.bbtheme</strong> file to ~/Library/Application Support/Bluebird and restart Bluebird to refresh its list of themes. (You may have to create the Bluebird directory if it doesn't already exist.

<strong>Updated</strong>: Here's a screen shot of the theme in action.

Tell all your friends. Enjoy.
