<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Those-Hunt-Night-Barbara-Hambly/dp/0345361326/sr=8-1/qid=1158235930/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-8238334-6486205?ie=UTF8&s=books" title="Those Who Hunt The Night">Those Who Hunt The Night</a></i> is one of the best vampire stories I've read. It would make a fantastic movie, perhaps with Antonio Banderas in the lead role as Don Simon Ysidro and Kevin Spacey as Asher.

Rating: Excellent on all accounts
