A long time ago I learned a simple exercise to help put a bad day into perspective. Having just had a pretty awful day I thought I give it a try.

1.  It was a balmy 70 degrees this afternoon, so I opened the windows when I got home. Each window has sprouted a very happy cat.

2.  I have enough leftovers from the last round of "I'm-feeling-good-so-lets-cook" a couple of weekends ago, so I'm eating good food tonight.

3. ...


Hmm

3. In just 3 hours I'll be in bed falling asleep, and escaping this strained existence that passes for my life these days for a few hours.
