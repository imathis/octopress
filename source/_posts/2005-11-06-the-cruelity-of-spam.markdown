So one flavor of spam spoofs the sending address to be the same as the receiving address. Thus it looks like the mail came from yourself. I am not sure what the asshole creating the spam thinks this will cause me to do, but there you go.

For the past month I have had Michele's email account set to be read in my email client. I wanted to make sure I had gotten ahold of everyone she knew, and for some I only had email addresses. Tonight when I checked the mail there was a mail from Michele. My heart stopped for a moment. Then I realized it had to be some cowheaded spammer spoofing her address.

What I wouldn't give for five minutes alone in a room with this vile creature and a baseball bat.
