This morning's windshield repair got off to an inauspicious start when the technician called me from my work location. Oops. Luckily it's only about a 25 minute drive and he was able to come straight to the apartment.

In examining the situation he determined that the original rain sensor (what appeared to be a thick, rubbery film, was still on the sensor head. When combined with the new one on the windshield itself, the doubled thickness was enough to keep the epoxy from gripping and the head unit fell off. This, apparently was the problem during the second visit as well.

The guy this morning found the additional sensor and was able to get a good seating of the sensor head all the way around. I'll keep the car out of the sun for an hour or so and then we'll see. After all this futzing around I want to take it to the car wash and see if the rain sensing automatic wipers feature still works.

So far, so good though.
