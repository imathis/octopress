I had a wonderful day of cooking today. Michele and I have been talking about a homemade carrot cake for a while. We even bought the cream cheese and carrots last weekend. Today I was in the "mood" and the resulting cake was spectacular. While this apartment may have some faults, the accuracy of the oven temperature isn't one of them. It makes a great cake.

We also had a nice sirloin from our new favorite butcher. We had talked about making beef stew with it, but while I was perusing the Betty Crocker cookbook for a suitable recipe I stumbled across Szechwan Beef Stir Fry. Carrots, corn, green pepper, thinly sliced beef and a spicy hoisin sauce with garlic, ginger root, and crushed red pepper flakes. It was delicious.

Oh, and we started the day with a brunch of Huevos Rancheros. When we make the Old El Paso taco mix there is always a small portion of taco-seasoned meat left over. I make a baked omelet, with the spicy meat and some shredded cheese. When it is ready we spread salsa on top for a fantastic flavor combination. MMM-mmm good.

We eat pretty good around here.
