Just wanted to give you a preview of whats to come on this site...



  1. I'll be releasing a product in the next few months I'm calling "Interviews with Self-Made Millionaires".  I've been finding and meeting people who have actually done it....quit their job, started their own business, and are now worth in excess of $1 Million (and in some cases $50 million or more).

In the interviews they'll be sharing how they did, the secrets to their success, and where they made mistakes along the way.  I've done two of them so far, but I'm not quite ready to release it.  It will probably be a subscription product where for about $20/month you can get a new interview each month as a CD mailed to your house or as an MP3 download to put on your iPod.

I am REALLY excited about this for a lot of reasons.  In terms of the potential to really help people, I think it could be the best product available anywhere to learn entrepreneurship and wealth building.




  2. After I complete the 30 day marketing challenge, I'd like to do another article series, but this one will be a 30 day challenge to start a business for less than $100 and get my first customer.  It will be a live demonstration of sorts.  Also another great project that I think people will get a lot of value out of...


  3. I'd like to create a page on this website that contains a list of successful companies which have been started for under $100.  It will be a hall-of-fame that will list annual revenues of each company and some info about their founders.  This could be a big inspiration to anyone who needs a reminder that "yes, it really is possible, if they're doing it I can too".


Thoughts?
