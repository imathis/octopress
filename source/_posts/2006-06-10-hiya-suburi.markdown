Today's kendo workout was a good one for me. I blew it off on Wednesday evening mostly because I didn't want to go, but in part because I was tired. I ended up going to sleep about 8:30 that evening; getting almost nine hours that night. A fair trade I think.

Even though I haven't worked out in two weeks I'm not too sore this evening. I think the conditioning in my legs will return fairly quickly. What is going to give me fits for a while are my shoulders. Much of the work in kendo involves holding your arms out in front of you, doing this continuously for a couple of hours really strains the muscles in your shoulders and upper back.

We started with the usually practice cuts, alternating <em>men</em> (head) strikes with <em>kote</em> (wrist) strikes. The hardest exercise is called <em>hiya suburi</em>, which involves rapid strikes and footwork. You shift backward while preparing for a <em>men</em> strike, and then step forward while executing the strike. Then repeat. Fifty times. Adding speed until you are basically running in place and striking as fast as you can. It's a lot harder to do that it sounds from my meager description. It's the only aerobic exercise in the lot, and it leaves everyone winded.

I had some reluctance about going again today, but felt good about it afterwards. The hardest part is starting over again at the beginning. When I made my decision o set aside active participation in karate-do it was the the right decision. I have not truly regretted it in the years that have passed. However, starting back in a dojo seriously is a reminder of what might have been.

Seems I'm getting a lot of that these days.
