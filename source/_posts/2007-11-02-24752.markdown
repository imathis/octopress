I'm not sure when the phrase "twenty-four by seven" entered the mainstream.  Recently it has grown to become "twenty-four by seven by three-sixty-five."  Which I think is wrong.

Twenty-four by seven means twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  Following the "hours per day, days per week" pattern, the next number given, three-sixty-five, should be weeks per <i>something</i>.  Instead it's days per year, a retreat.

The phrase should be "twenty-four by seven by fifty-two," or "twenty-four by three-sixty-five."
