Meeting people through a computer services has pluses and minuses. One of the biggest minuses is the totality of the end of communication. Once either party moves the match to "closed" the other party is helpless. Over the past few days I have been exchanging messages with a woman who I found to be very engaging and insightful. I was having fun "talking" to her.

Inexplicably this morning I found that she had closed the match and gave as her reason "other." Her last message was very short, out of context and didn't make sense to me. Going back and re-reading everything we wrote back and forth I cannot see what might have caused her to abandon the conversation. Her last message before the cryptic one ended with several questions that I was looking forward to answering.

Balls.
