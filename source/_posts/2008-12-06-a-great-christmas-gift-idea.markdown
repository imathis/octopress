Do you knowing someone who is a budding entrepreneur?

Do you know someone who'd be great at running their own business - if they could only find the motivation to get started?

Do you know someone who hates their job?

You might want to consider getting them a copy of [Breaking Free](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/).

**For the next week only, I'll be offering a special deal:  For all paperback copies sold (with shipping in the U.S.) I'll be signing each book with a personal note of your choosing.**

That means your gift will contain a personal note from the author!  Whether you just want to wish them happy holidays, or mention a specific reason you thought of them, it will make the book that much more special.

After purchasing the book, just [send me an email](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/contact/) with the personal note you'd like me to include.  Be sure to include your name & shipping address as well so that your note goes on the right book!  The note will appear on the inside cover.

The book costs just $24.95 (including shipping) and can be [purchased online](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/) in just a few minutes.

Be sure to check out the dozens of emails I've gotten from people who've read the book and loved it by [clicking here](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/)!

Remember, this offer expires in 1 week (last day is December 13th) and is good for the paperback version of the book shipped within the U.S. only (sorry - the copies which ship internationally go out from a different location so I can't get my hands on them!).

Anyway, I hope this makes your holiday shopping just a little bit easier!
