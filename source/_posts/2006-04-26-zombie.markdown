The past couple of evenings I have been a total zombie. Getting up the energy to make dinner has been an effort. Monday evening I cheated and just had scrambled eggs and bacon. It only takes a few minutes to make, it's hot, delicious, and good comfort food for me. Last night I ordered-in from the nearby Chinese restaurant. Best part, other than spicy good food, is leftovers for lunch today.

Monday night I had a bout of insomnia and was still awake after midnight. Of course this added to my lack of energy yesterday, and, even though I had a good night's sleep last night, I still feel tired today. About all I've been able to do several nights in a row is to sit in the over-sized chair watching Tivo. I haven't even bothered to bring a laptop with me. (I will admit that not being able to clearly focus on the screen makes bring the laptop with me a bit of a downer.)

This afternoon, after my eye exam, I hope to get some laundry done. Maybe having a chore to accomplish as soon as I get home will give me some impetus for the rest of the evening.
