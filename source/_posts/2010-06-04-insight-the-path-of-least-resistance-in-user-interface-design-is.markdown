This person might just  want a "new" Honda Accord and doesn't care if it's a 2010 or 2011.

It's harder to build technology based on how humans think, but it tends to be better when you do.  Google does a great job of "understanding" what you meant with fuzzy matching, for example.

The example above really isn't even that bad (some people want to choose  a year).  What other examples of "database driven user-interfaces" have you come across?
