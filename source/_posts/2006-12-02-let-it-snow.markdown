Thursday we had the first snow storm of the year here in Kansas City. All day it threatened to snow and finally about 2:30 some little tiny flakes appeared in the air. An hour later it was snowing hard and before it tapered off in the night I got about six inches of the fluffy white stuff.<br />
<br />
Friday the sun returned and most of the pavement melted clear, leaving a nice white blanket on the ground. Driving around today revealed that where I live was at the western edge of the storm, only thirty minutes travel was necessary to reach parts of town that looked as if no snow had fallen at all.
