If you have some interesting insights into business, entrepreneurship, real estate, marketing, passive income, etc - then I’d like to hear from you!

Up until now - StartBreakingFree.com has largely been about posting my thoughts.  I get some interaction with the readers in the comments, but I'd like more.  I know there are tons of experienced entrepreneurs who read this blog on a regular basis and you (the readers) deserve to get the benefit of their wisdom and experience too!

So as of today I'm accepting applicants for contributing authors to StartBreakingFree.com who would be able to post to this blog about once a week or every other week.  Length of the article is not a primary concern (they can even be as short as one paragraph if that’s all you need - often being concise is better).  What is of primary concern is that the content is original and the advice useful!

Good topics would include:



	
  * Challenges you are facing in your own business

	
  * How you faced and overcame those challenges

	
  * What's working well for you in business and what isn't

	
  * Exciting new trends that you think others should be aware of

	
  * Business ideas that you think have great potential - but perhaps you don't have time to pursue personally

	
  * Lifestyles topics on the benefits of breaking free

	
  * Many more...



The site has grown rapidly in recent months and we now have more than 2,250 daily readers.  As a contributing author you are welcome to include a short “about the author” section at the bottom of your posts which can include a link of your choice (for example, if you have a related business or personal blog).  This can be a great way to send some qualified traffic your way.

Also, just to be clear this does NOT mean I will personally stop making posts.  I will still be writing my own articles as well - but adding a few more authors will hopefully allow you the reader to get some additional insight from other entrepreneurs.

**To apply please email me at “brian at startbreakingfree dotcom” and tell me briefly (in no more than a few sentences) why you’d like to contribute and how you can bring a unique perspective.**  Real world experience and business success is a plus.  Feel free to include any writing samples if you have some handy and I’ll get back to you ASAP.
