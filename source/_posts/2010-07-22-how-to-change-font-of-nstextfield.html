<p>I spent nearly a hour finding the way of changing the font of text field in Interface Builder, and I found it's really easy but hard to find...</p>

<p>Select the NSTextField you want to change its font, press Command+T or choose "Show Fonts" under Font menu, and change font like in other applications in Mac OS X...</p>

<p>Really obvious, but really hard to find...</p>
