Octopress is a framework designed by [Brandon Mathis](http://brandonmathis.com) for [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), the blog aware static site generator powering [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).
To start blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Octopress
All of that is already taken care of. Simply [clone or fork Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress), install dependencies and the theme, and you're set.

## What's new in 2.0?

Short answer: Everything. Octopress is now based on [mojombo/jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) has been completely rewritten from the ground up with a mountain of goodies.

Octopress comes with:

- A semantic HTML5 template
- A Mobile friendly responsive ([320 and up](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/)) layout (rotate, or resize your browser and see)
- Built in 3rd party support for Twitter, Google Plus One, Disqus Comments, Pinboard, Delicious, and Google Analytics
- An easy deployment strategy using Github pages or Rsync
- Built in support for POW and Rack servers
