The front page of today's Kansas City Star has an article about an incoming freshman basketball player who has been arrested on suspicion of shooting a passerby with a plastic BB from a BB gun, possibly while intoxicated.

Personally, if I were the coach or athletic directory at a university, I would make it abundantly clear to those students who were there, in part, because of their ability with a ball, that any infraction of the rules of the team, the institution, or society, would result in their being removed from the team and stripped of any scholarship related to their sport.

That we again and again appear to have a double standard when it comes to enforcing the rules when it comes to athletes is appalling.  Being able to dunk a basketball or catch a football is not license to treat the rest of the world as somehow less than you.

The game that got you a spot at the university has rules, that when violated bring a penalty.  The game of life has rules too.  Ones that should be just as true for athletes as it is for other citizens.  Break those rules, and you are off the team.
