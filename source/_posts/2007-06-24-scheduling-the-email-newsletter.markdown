I think the email subscription is going out too often: every evening.

While this content is hopefully useful to readers, you are probably a lot like me: busy, inbox overflowing, and lots of things to read.

I'd like to send out updates perhaps every 3 days, but currently [FeedBlitz](http://www.feedblitz.com/) doesn't offer this.  For right now I've set it to go out once per week on Wednesday, but I may be able to adjust it further in the future.

The update emails will be longer, but then you can skim for articles that catch your eye.

Thoughts?
