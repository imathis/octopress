I have to say that I am very impressed. At home I have my Powerbook plugged into a KDS Visual Sensations 19" monitor. The OS immediately recognized the monitor and the settings it was capable of supporting. The OS also immediately setup a multiple monitor desktop. Just like that. How very cool.

As I write this one screen is showing Lord of The Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, and the other is supporting a chat client, my e-mail and this browser window. There is no visible delay or screen freeze. This is simply amazing. After years of trying to get enough power to support the applications and their usage that I wanted I finally have what I want.

All it took was switching to Macintosh. My hat is off to Apple.
