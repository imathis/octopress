It seems that one of the reasons we are invading Iraq is to ensure that they have a good wireless communications infrastructure. This <a href="http://siliconvalley.internet.com/news/article.php/2171271" target="_blank">InternetNews.com</a> story, covers the introduction of a bill by Congressman Darrell Issa (R.-Calif.) Wednesday, demanding that the Department of Defense and USAID show favor to CDMA (<a href="http://inews.webopedia.com/SHARED/search_action.asp?Term=CDMA&Template_Name=inews.webopedia.com" target="_blank">define</a>) technology made by San Diego-based QUALCOMM (<a href="http://www.internetnews.com/stocks/quotes/quote.php/QCOM" target="_blank">Quote</a>, <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/stocks/quotes/quote.php/QCOM/DESC" target="_blank">Company Info</a>).

And here I was worried that we were invading a sovereign nation because of greedy, capitalistic oil companies. Silly me. It's for the greedy, capitalistic wireless companies. Gosh, I feel so much better now.
