I have been doing some tidying up among the many files, templates, and settings that make this site work.

I added a link to the site itself from the <a href="http://www.zanshin.net/refer/index.php">referers</a> page. Ever since I posted information linking to the Panther preview, and other new goodies from Apple, I have been getting tons of hits to my refer page. Once there it isn't obvious how to get back here, hence the new link.

Also I am in the process of making each section of this page a template module so that I don't have the same code repeated in multiple places. You should see no difference as a result of these changes, but it will save me maintenance time.

Lastly, I've added a link in the menu to my professional self. You can visit <a href="http://www.partitionsoftware.com/">partition software</a> as you wish now.
