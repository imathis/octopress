Be sure to check out 37 Signals live web cast tomorrow.  Their last few have been pretty good, but this one is right up our alley:  How to go from business idea to business launch, something I've [written about quite a bit](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/) in the past.

================
Please join us this Thursday, September 11 at 11am central for the next edition of [37signals Live](http://live.37signals.com/).

This show’s topic will be “The Starting Line: From Idea to Execution”. How do you start your business? How do you take that idea you had and actually do something with it? How do you get from thought to action? How do you deal with business plans and projections and all that stuff you’re supposed to do when you get started. Do you hire people? Do you design business cards? All that good stuff.

We look forward to seeing you for [37signals Live](http://live.37signals.com/) this Thursday!

Also worth reading:  Check out [this story](http://www.erica.biz/2008/september-goals-update-one-year-since-i-sold-my-business/) of a 26 year old entrepreneur who sold her first business for $1 Million, and is now deciding what to do next.  Sometimes, we spend so long trying to accomplish a goal that when we finally do we sort of miss the struggle (also known as the [Paradox of Success](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FParadox-Success-John-R-ONeil%2Fdp%2F0874777720&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)).
