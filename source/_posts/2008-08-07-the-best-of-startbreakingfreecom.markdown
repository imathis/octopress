One unfortunate part about blogging is that great content can quickly get pushed off the home page as you continue to make new posts.

New subscribers sometimes miss out on some "hidden gems" from the past.

I was looking back at some posts from the past year, and these really stood out to me as some of the best content that could really help people get their first successful business started (and quit their jobs).

I hope you enjoy them.  Even long time subscribers may see something they missed or that needs reviewing:
