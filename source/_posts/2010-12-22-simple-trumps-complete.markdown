Three articles I've read in the past month.  All with the same lesson about what makes a web application "catch on".

1. Wayne Ting, a guy who started a Facebook-like app at Columbia University around the same time as Facebook explains how they lost to Facebook: [they had too many features](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/rorycellanjones/2010/12/wayne_ting_nearly_a_billionair.html).


> "A good website should have functionalities that 70 or 80% of users want to use. We had functions that only 10% wanted"


2. Marc Hedlund, a guy who started Wesabe (a competitor which lost to Mint.com) thinks they lost because [they gave users too much work](http://blog.precipice.org/why-wesabe-lost-to-mint).


> Mint focused on making the user do almost no work at all, by automatically editing and categorizing their data, reducing the number of fields in their signup form, and giving them immediate gratification as soon as they possibly could


3. Netflix's Chief Product Officer summed up the entirety of his years of testing various designs in [just 3 words](http://www.quora.com/What-types-of-things-does-Netflix-A-B-test-aside-from-member-sign-up).


> If I had to summarize our learnings in three words: "simple trumps complete."


I think we're seeing a pattern here.
