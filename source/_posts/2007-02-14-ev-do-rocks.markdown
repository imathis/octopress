After just a few minutes of usage from my work location, I can say that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVDO" title="Evolution-Data Optimized">EV-DO</a> rocks. The mobile broadband card I received yesterday is outstanding. The <a href="http://internetfrog.com/mypc/speedtest/" title="Speed Test">speed test</a> over at <a href="http://internetfrog.com/" title="InternetFrog">InternetFrog</a> consistently gives me numbers in the 650 kbps range. No, it isn't as fast as my cable modem at home, but it is unrestricted, unfettered, and unlimited access.

Hot diggity dog.
