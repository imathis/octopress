Don't be afraid to ask!

[Neil Patel](http://www.quicksprout.com/), put up an interesting post on his blog today about his mentor.  He also generously offered to give his own time in case anyone had questions.

As you may know, I'm very big on finding good mentors (especially people who are successful and have [already done what I'm trying to accomplish](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-worst-mistake-you-can-make-when-asking-for-advice/)).

Well, Neil fits the bill.  At the ripe old age of 23 he is a very successful entrepreneur and a millionaire from several web businesses he's started (I'm assuming this based on his [very interesting life story](http://www.quicksprout.com/about/#neilpatel) where he talks about losing a million dollars on a single investment).  He started [Crazy Egg](http://www.crazyegg.com/) and several other web companies you may be familiar with.

Anyway after reading his [blog post on mentors](http://www.quicksprout.com/2009/01/06/looking-for-a-mentor-why-not-use-mine/) I decided to give Neil a call and get his feedback on my current project: [www.UniversityTutor.com](http://www.UniversityTutor.com).

Surprisingly, I got right through to him.  His first reaction about my business?  Get involved in online tutoring and change the business model to take a cut of each hour instead of a monthly fee.  I'm still trying to work out exactly how this might work and I've been researching online tutoring today, but what do you think?  If you have any experience with online tutoring and best practices please leave a comment below.

Moral of the story: the key to finding good mentors is simple but no one does it - just ask!  You'd be surprised how accessible some people are and in my experience successful people are usually happy to help.

Second lesson: try to give back in any way you can.  How will I do that?  By asking you to do yourself a favor and go [subscribe to Neil's blog](http://www.quicksprout.com/).  It's quite good.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
