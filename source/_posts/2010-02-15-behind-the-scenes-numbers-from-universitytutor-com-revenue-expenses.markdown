Things have been growing nicely at my business, [UniversityTutor.com](http://www.UniversityTutor.com), in the last few months.

Here are a few graphs that I have auto-generated each week to see what's going on.  I really like the idea of having a "dashboard" for your business like this to help you see the cycles and spot anomalies early on.  If you can't measure it then you don't know how close you are getting to your goal, so I recommend having something like this for your business if you don't already.  These I custom programmed but you could have your programmer do something similar or make them in Google Analytics or Excel.

**These show daily totals for a bunch of different metrics that I track, and a cumulative total for number of paying subscribers**.


## The last month:

## A few points...





	
  * If you are wondering what happened around Jan 1st to cause subscribers to go up, I don't really know.  I think it was just the new year.  December was sluggish.

	
  * I did do some marketing to get new tutors (hence the spike in the yellow line) but I don't think this  is what caused the whole subscriber increase - it was probably just from tutors starting the new year and wanting to get new jobs.

	
  * At $10 per month, the subscribers is the main metric I watch.  To get an idea of the business model you can check out the [tutoring jobs](http://www.universitytutor.com/tutoring_jobs) page.  So you can multiply $10 times the number of subscribers to get an idea of the monthly revenue.

	
  * The expenses are almost nil, about $70 per month in web hosting cost and sometimes I play around with different marketing expenses but these aren't much.  So the profit margin is high and it's been cash flow positive since almost the first month I launched it.

	
  * It is now [two years ago](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/) that I started this project and I have to say I thought it would have grown much faster than it did.  Two years is a long time!  But then again I'm always impatient and there were some [failed experiments](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/universitytutor-revenues-fall-by-50/) along the way which slowed things down.

	
  * On the plus side, it is truly passive at this point (I spend probably an hour per week on it) and it is growing nicely so it could become a popular site and valuable asset over time.


Probably the best thing that can help the site grow at this point is to start ranking better in search engines for some tutoring related keywords (to draw in more parents and students).  The site ranks really well in some cities, but not so well in others, so hopefully as it continues to garner new links it will build reputation with Google.

Hopefully this helps give you get an idea of what goes on behind the scenes in a business like this.   If there is anything else you want to see, just let me know in the comments.  And if you have any ideas on how I could take it the next level, I'm always curious to hear people's feedback on [the site](http://www.universitytutor.com).

Until next time, keep breaking free!
