Dear Spammer(s),

Okay. You win this round. I've been forced to remove comments from my sites because I am sick and tired of spending an increasing amount of time everyday removing your vile spew from my site. So now no one can comment here at all.

Fuck you very much.

However, all is not lost. I'm in the process of switching the back end of this site, and my <a href="http://andifyoudidknow.com" title="And If You Did Know.com">wife's</a> site to Expression Engine. Which has a membership feature that will require proof of humanness before comments can be left.

Sometimes technology is a a good thing.
