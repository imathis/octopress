[![New Zealand Helicopter Tour](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/11/new-zealand1-150x150.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/11/new-zealand1.jpg)Every once in a while I like to sit down and make a list of cool things I'd like to do.  You know, the sort of things that you typically have in the back of your mind that would be fun, but for whatever reason (sometimes laziness, sometimes because they are scary) you never get around to doing.  The sort of things that most people only TALK about doing, and never do because they're stuck in corporate America.

I like to call these "peak life experiences".  The type of experience where you can go home that day and feel happy knowing you did something unique.  These make great stories to tell your friends and family.

Here are a few that I've gotten around to in the past year.  Some started out as new years resolutions, others just came up through brain storming sessions like this one:



	
  * Bought my first piece of investment real estate, and made it cash flow

	
  * Put up my business (University Tutor) for sale with a business broker

	
  * Took some acting classes

	
  * Hired a personal trainer

	
  * Took first place at a local speaking competition

	
  * Dated a girl I actually liked

	
  * Made a bunch of new female friends

	
  * Attended four conferences on various subjects (ongoing education)

	
  * Built a blog for my book, achieved a #1 page ranking on Google

	
  * Tried rock climbing, yoga, and joined a volleyball team

	
  * Tried stand up comedy at open mic night



Here are some more I'd like to accomplish in the next year:

	
  * Sell University Tutor for a nice profit

	
  * Purchase 10 pieces of rental real estate (at least $3000/month in passive income)

	
  * Buy a BMW M3

	
  * Get my concealed handgun license

	
  * Get a personal (virtual) assistant

	
  * Get booked/paid to travel to another city for modeling/acting

	
  * Get six pack abs

	
  * Make at least one quality post per week to this blog

	
  * Travel to Australia to surf

	
  * Take a helicopter tour of New Zealand

	
  * Visit at least four friends in different cities

	
  * Launch a new business (can't disclose details right now, but we'll call it codename BR for the moment)



To me this is the most exciting part about being self employed: you have the freedom and time to do all of these things.  What "peak life experiences" have you been putting off?
