I like goals, and especially new years resolutions.

I went back and reviewed some of my 2007 new years resolutions.  Some I had accomplished (buying my first investment property and making it cash flow) and some are still in progress (sale of a business).  But in all honesty, the majority of them I had not accomplished, primarily because they are no longer goals.  I guess my goals change often.

Nevertheless, I think its awfully worthwhile to write your goals down (and far more often than once a year!).  Here are a few tips on your 2008 resolutions:




	
  * **Write them down**
Goals in your head are no more than ideas.  Writing them forces you to get all the details.  (Yes, typing counts)


	
  * **Make them measurable**
Saying "I want to earn more" isn't measurable.  You can never know if you actually achieved it or not.  Saying "I want to earn $76,500 in the year 2008" is measurable.


	
  * **Don't forget the how**
Careful what you wish for.  Saying "I want to weight 146 lbs" doesn't specify how.  There are some unhealthy ways to accomplish that, and you want to be specific.


	
  * **Keep it positive**
Focus on what you want, not what you don't want.  Instead of saying "I stop hating my boss", try "I get a raise and promotion".


	
  * **Use the present tense**
Saying "I'm going to..." or "I will try..." is weak.  Write the goal as if it has already taken place.  "I date Heidi Klum."


	
  * **Make them ambitious yet possible**
Force yourself to reach, but if you make them too ambitious you'll be disappointed.  There should probably about a 50/50 chance of accomplishing it in your own mind.

	
  * **Make them public**
I don't always recommend telling your goals to people who won't be supportive, but making them public in a supportive place will help you stay on track.  We're more likely to follow through with peer pressure, which is why...



**You have the opportunity to write your #1 goal to accomplish in 2008 below.  Please leave a comment (sticking as best you can to the guidelines above, doesn't have to be perfect).  If you leave your email, I promise I'll check up on you before the end of 2008 to see how things are going!**
