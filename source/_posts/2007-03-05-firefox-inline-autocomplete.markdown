To turn on inline autocomplete in the Firefox web browser...

1. Enter about:config in the URL field
2. Right-click on the page and create a new Boolean value
3. Enter <b>browser.urlbar.autoFill</b> as the preference name (note, case-sensitive: 'F', not 'f')
4. Set the value to <b>true</b>

Why this isn't exposed in the preferences I'll never know.
