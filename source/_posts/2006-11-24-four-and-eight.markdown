Participating in <a href="http://www.fussy.org/nablopomo.html" title="NaBloPoMo">NaBloPoMo</a> (National Blog Posting Month) has been an interesting challenge. Trying to come up with some thing to say every day, and then remember to capture it here before midnight has been interesting. I don't really mind, but I am glad that it isn't NaBloPoYr.

The readership numbers for zanshin are up a bit as a result of the traffic from the NaBloPoMo <a href="http://pinkelephants.org/nablopomo/randomizer.html">randomizer</a>. Already, with still six days to go in November, this is the fourth largest month for unique visitors, and the eighth largest month for total page views in the last twelve. While my readership numbers aren't huge (we're talking dozens not hundreds) there has been a jump in daily visits. Fifty or seventy visits a day is now common, whereas fifteen or twenty was common before.

I'd like to think that at least some of those visits are from new regular readers, but I guess only time will tell. Come December will my numbers dip back down to where there were twelve months ago, or will they stay at their new, higher level?
