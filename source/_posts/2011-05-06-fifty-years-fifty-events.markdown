This year I decided to switch things up a bit and post a list of events, one per year, for each of the fifty years I've been alive. I like to tell people that I am a child of the space age, as Alan Shepard became the first American in outer space on May 5, 1961 just two days before I was born on May 7, 1961.

All of these events were found on <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://wikipedia.com/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> by searching for the numerical year, and then scrolling to the month of May on the summary page that resulted.
