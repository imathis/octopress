I just finished listening to Tim Ferriss's _The Four Hour Work Week_ for the second time on audio book and I have to say it's outstanding.

If I had to pick one book on entrepreneurship that came out this year, it would probably be this one.  You owe it to yourself to [check it out](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307353133?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307353133).

One thing that Tim is perhaps the best in the world at, is what he likes to call lifestyle design.  This is basically the idea that that you can be extremely mobile and just do incredibly fun stuff all the time.  It sounds simple, but how many of us actually have brand new, exciting/scary experiences in life on a regular basis?  Exactly.

That's what so great about entrepreneurship: if can give you this lifestyle that most people only dream about or give up 40 years of their life to get.

Anyway, Tim has a new show coming out (it's a pilot actually) where he attempts to master a new skill that would normally take 5-20 years in just 1 week.  This could be a new language, martial arts, dancing, etc.

Check out the [trailer for the show here](http://tr.im/1rak):



The show will be on **December 4th (tomorrow)** at **11pm ET, 10pm CST, 9pm MT, and 11pm PST**.  Set an alert to check it out.  Tim will be holding a live Q&A; on his blog after the show if you have questions.
