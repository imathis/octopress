I have always challenged myself to develop my personal and professional skills by giving presentations. I've done so at user groups, internal tech nights and "unconferences", and I even gave a talk at [Ignite Brisbane](http://www.ignitebrisbane.net/) this year. My latest presentation was at XConf Sydney, which is an internal [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) conference run twice a year.

My talk was well received, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was still missing something. The odd thing was that this wasn't a feeling I had experienced after other presentations, including my Ignite talk. I soon realised that a few of my colleagues took a different approach to mine when approaching how to develop their talk.

My usual style of presentation is to share my experiences and learnings related to the topic at hand. This is the approach I used to show people both how and why they should use feedback as a tool to improve their own skills, and it is how I showed people what I learnt when I automatically provisioned a fleet of development machines with [Babushka](http://babushka.me/).

When compared to talks by people like [Brian Guthrie](https://twitter.com/#!/bguthrie) and [Scott Robinson](https://twitter.com/#!/quadhome), titled 'Too Much Magic' and 'Just Die Already' respectively, I realised a key difference: ranting (or more accurately, the lack thereof). My talk wasn't borne out of a rant, and I can't help but feel that the difference made the task of getting my point across a little harder.

I should clarify that I don't mean standing up and yelling at or berating people until they get sick of questioning you and start doing what you say. When I say "ranting", I mean using the passion and excitement you feel for a given topic and channelling that into a structured, focused talk which highlights the underlying point you are attempting to convey.

Now don't get me wrong, I have (nearly) always been pleased with the talks and presentations I have delivered, but they all seem to be focused around the notion of teaching people. The result is that I start from a position of having to convince everyone to believe what I say, and that I know what I am talking about. After listening to Brian and Scott's talks, I can help but think they had an easier task to simply share their opinion and let their passion prove their status as someone able to speak to the topic at hand.

The idea became self-evident when I also realised that the pattern of ranting is a key contributor to a large percentage of conversations I have with fellow ThoughtWorkers. It really is part of the culture, and it is common along the spectrum from new hires all the way up to Roy, our founder. My favourite conversations that I've had with some of my colleagues could have been given taglines like "BDD: just do it", or "Using Lean to scrap Scrum's waste".

So why not challenge yourself to find something you are truly passionate about and start telling people why you are right. You'll likely come across those who disagree, but that's where you'll really be able to refine your arguments. Now off I go to add a healthy dose of ranting to my favourite presentation decks.
