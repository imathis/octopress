In the two years or so that I've been hauling my Powerbook back and forth to work I've always managed to remember all the extras; the mouse and the power supply. Today I broke that streak as I have the computer and mouse here but no power supply.

Nuts.

I recently bought a sleeve style bag that is just big enough for the computer itself, with no extras, and I've been tempted to carry the machine back and forth to work using it. However, I'd need a second power supply to leave at work to really make this minimalist approach work. Perhaps leaving the power supply at home is a sign. Maybe a sign that I should get a spare power supply, maybe a sign that my short term memory is going.
