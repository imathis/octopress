Marcus Frind created a free online dating website called [PlentyOfFish.com](http://www.plentyoffish.com/).  It serves up 1.6 billion pages views each month yet Marcus is the only employee, he works about one hour per day, and the website brings in about $10 million per year.

In [this excellent Inc Magazine article](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20090101/and-the-money-comes-rolling-in_Printer_Friendly.html) Marcus sums up his idea of a great business model:



> Pick a market in which the competition charges money for its service, build a lean operation with a "dead simple" free website, and pay for it using Google AdSense.



This is basically the ad supported business model which requires lots of page views but can work.

On the other end of the spectrum we have 37Signals who also has a [multi-million dollar per year suite of products](http://www.37signals.com/) which people pay monthly subscriptions to use.

Here is founder David Heinemeier Hansson's [view on a great business model](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1366-a-radical-idea-charge-people-for-your-product) which actually charges money instead of relying on ad-revenue:



> You have customers, they pay you money for the product or service, and you get profits! It’s almost too simple to work. Of course, 37signals didn’t come up with this idea on its own, either: I’ve heard that over time—hundreds of years actually—this has been how most businesses have made their money. But somehow that notion got lost in the Web world...

  Web entrepreneurs would be better off starting their businesses in the way most offline entrepreneurs do: Use a small amount of seed capital to make a good product that appeals to a client base that is willing to pay you for it. Then, over time, use the money you make from your customers to improve the product or to create more products—allowing you to attract more paying customers, which then lets you invest more into the business, and so on.




So which is better - a paid website or a free/ad-supported website?

I think both models make sense.  You have to look at how much value your site is really contributing to people's lives.  If you are helping them earn a living or save money, or performing a critical business task - then yes people will probably pay for it and you have a good business model to charge for.

But, on the other hand, if your website is a novelty, entertainment, or more fun for people than it is essential, or if you are trying to beat an incumbent who is already doing the pay model successfully - then maybe you have a good candidate for a free, ad-supported, website.

What do you think?
