I came across these interviews I did a while back, and wanted to repost them for those who haven't heard them.  Hope you get something out of it!

Kevin Morgan is the CEO of Eskimo Hut, a chain of convenience stores.  He started with just one store in Amarillo, TX and now owns 17 of them across the south western U.S.  Oh yeah, and he is just 31 years old.
