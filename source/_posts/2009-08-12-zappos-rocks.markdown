Yesterday afternoon, about 1:30 Central time, I ordered a pair of shoes from Zappos.com. The are famous for their customer service, and free shipping plus free returns. Last night I got an email from them stating that my order, while made with the free shipping option, was being bumped up to a faster shipping option.

Today, while at home for lunch, the UPS man appeared, banged on the door twice and left. Sitting on the porch was a Zappos box.

My new shoes were delivered in less than 24 hours, closer to 22 hours actually. Amazing.

Lets hope that this kind of service continues under the new Amazon management, and that some of this kind of shipping goodness spreads from Zappos to Amazon.
