This has been bugging me for a while now, and somebody needs to finally say it: Network Marketing is not a worthwhile endeavor, stay away from it!

The number of people who are caught up in this stuff is staggering and it seems like at least once a week I get contacted by someone trying to get me to join some program.

It's really annoying, and there is no quicker way to ruin your reputation among your friends and contacts then trying to get them to join this stuff.  Smart, respectable business people stay away from network marketing like the plague and it will INSTANTLY kill your credibility if they get even a whiff that you're trying to get them to join one of these things.

I'll probably piss off half the readers of this blog by posting this, but thats fine because it needs to be said.  For some reason the "home based business" industry is surrounded by this stuff...get rich quick schemes, network marketing, and all sorts of shady offerings...and that bothers me.

Even the Google ads which show up automatically on this site seem to come up as network marketing type stuff half the time (haven't figured out how to change that, if anyone knows leave me a comment)...which means they are targeting people who want to start their own business.  Being a network marketer is not starting your own business!

If you want to break free from your job...you're going to have to do it honestly, ethically, and with hard work.  You're not going to do it by selling some herbal supplement or lower electric bills or energy drink to your friends.  And you're certainly not going to do it by pissing off every contact you've ever made trying to get them to join you.

**If you can't explain your business in one sentence, you're either hiding something or don't know what you're doing**

I was in an elevator the other day and struck up a conversation with the elderly woman next to me.  I asked her what she was up to and she said she was going to a meeting for XYZ (I can't even remember the name).  When I asked her what it was she gave me the most cryptic reply..."well, we do a lot of things really, but mostly...we find ways to help people."

Right away the little alarm bell is going off in my brain...the same one I get when telemarketers call or Jehovah's witnesses come to the door...damnit, she is a network marketer.

If you can't explain clearly what your business is in one sentence...you're either hiding something or you haven't figured it out yet either.

Sure enough...her next words were "why don't you give me your card and I can tell you more about it some time".

"Well is it network marketing?"  I asked.

"Sort of", she said, "but not really...we really just help people.  Let me get your card and we can talk more some time".

"No offense", I said, "but if its anything related to that I really don't want to get involved".

Her mouth hung open for a second, and then she stormed out of the elevator, visibly shocked.

**Why You Shouldn't Do It**

Does network marketing even work?  I certainly haven't researched it extensively...the thing is every network marketer will tell you they KNOW someone who is super rich from doing it, but I've never met that illusive person.

On the other hand, I HAVE met dozens of millionaires who are legitimate business owners or are involved in real estate.  In fact, EVERY rich person I've ever met either owns their own business or owns lots of real estate (or both).

That's just my personal experience and not conclusive proof, but look at your own personal experience and see if it matches up.

That brings me to an important point.  Even if network marketing DID make lots of money (which I don't think it does for 99.9% of people), I STILL think you shouldn't do it.

Why?  Because in the process of making that money you would have pissed off all your friends and family hustling them to sell your vitamins!

What good is it to have all that money if your family hates you and the only friends you have left are other network marketers?

**Does It Feel Like You're Helping People?**

The only way to make a ton of money is help a bunch of people.  Period.  If you give a bunch of people a tremendous amount of value they will gladly give you some money for that.

I know, I know...your network marketing program is different from the others which all give it a bad name, etc...and the intense motivational weekend you went to made it sound like you were helping people who love the product.

Just be honest with yourself for a minute and forget all the delusional bullcrap, and ask yourself how you feel about what you're doing.  Maybe it REALLY IS a good product that helps people...if so why the tactics to get people to buy it.  If it feels dirty get out.

Its the same as people who bring fraudulent slip-and-fall lawsuits or don't disclose the patch repair done on their transmission when they go to sell a car.

Of course its possible to make money in slightly unethical ways in the short term...there is no doubt about that.  But I think ultimately the biggest person you end up hurting is yourself...both in terms of your pocket book and self-esteem.

Stay away from network marketing, and if you're in it already...forgive yourself (we all make mistakes) and get the hell out!
