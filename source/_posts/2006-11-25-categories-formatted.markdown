For too long now I have been ignoring a lack of style sheet on the individual category archive pages. Tonight I finally tackled the intricacies of MoveableType tags and CSS and built a proper page to display all the entries for each of the categories on my site. As a bonus these pages now include the code necessary for my page tracking system to track their views.

Of course now I am itching to revamp the entire site.
