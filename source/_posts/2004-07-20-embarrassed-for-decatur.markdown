I am embarrassed for Decatur Illinois. I grew up there and believe me it is no great shakes. An industry town, it has been slowly dying since the oil crisis and high unemployment days in the 1970s and 1980s. For years I have quietly defended Decatur from those who would smear it and drive it down further. For better or worse it is my hometown.

However, this summer's season of "Big Brother 5" features a total cretin from Decatur named Jason. He is the epitome of all that is wrong with men in America, and perhaps the world, today.

I am embarrassed for my hometown, and I embarrassed for my gender. I am so glad that I am not a macho, arrogant, meathead idiot like "Jace."
