<i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0040613/" title="Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House">Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House</a></i> is a light comedy with Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. Neither the best nor the worst light comedy every, just good clean fun.

Rating: He doesn't say "Judy" in this one either.
