Like most people I suspect, I didn't know the difference between an <i>acronym</i> and an <i>initialization</i> until quite recently.

An <strong>acronym</strong> is a series of letters pronounced as a word. An <strong>initialization</strong> is a series of letters pronounced as individual letters.

For example, ANSI, the American National Standards Institute, is pronounced "an-see." But AARP, the American Association of Retired Persons, is pronounced "aigh-aigh-are-pee."

Now you know.
