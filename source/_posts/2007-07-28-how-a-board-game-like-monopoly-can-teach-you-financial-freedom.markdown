[![Cash Flow Robert Kiyosaki Financial Freedom](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/cashflow-202-board-game1-150x150.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/cashflow-202-board-game1.jpg)I'm really starting to embrace this passive income idea.  Right now I'm relaxing by the pool with my laptop and my only goal for the entire day has been to cook some pan cakes, watch some Entourage, and go to a birthday party tonight.

But I thought I'd take a minute to write a quick post here about a game I've been playing lately called [Cash Flow](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KIELPC?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000KIELPC) (aff).

It's an educational board game created by Robert Kiyosaki, of Rich Dad Poor Dad fame, that is designed to teach you financial literacy.  People get intense when playing it, pulling out calculators, and negotiating deals...sort of like monopoly on steroids.

I don't recommend buying the game, because it's expensive and you'll probably have trouble finding people who want to play it with you anyway, but you may want to check if there is a cash flow [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) group in your area that plays it.

When I first played it, I underestimated how complex it was (it seemed too easy).

But it actually does a great job of teaching you balance sheets, income statements, evaluating deals, and the difference between investing for capital gains vs. cash flow.

Before playing the game, I understood all of those concepts enough to pass an exam in school.  But after playing the game a few times, I feel like I understand it one level deeper.  Enough to use those terms in casual conversation and even think one level beyond, if that makes sense.

Take a minute to find a group that plays it in your area....it will change the way you think about getting out of the rat race.
