Great video to watch.

As a side note: it's interesting for me to see people combining charity and entrepreneurship like this.  While I think the only way to make money is to help people, the goals of a non profit and a for profit company are not always in alignment.  I wonder if by combining the two you just end up with something that's not very good at making profit and not very good at charity.  I'd say make your money in a for profit company and then pursue a charity as a separate project, like Bill Gates.  What do you think?
