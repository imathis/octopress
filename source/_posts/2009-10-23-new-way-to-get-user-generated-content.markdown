title: New Way To Build User Generated Content Sites?

I've noticed a trend of sites coming out recently that are built around the idea of taking short, funny, user generated content.  Often users can submit them as text messages or emails.  Sort of like Twitter but on a particular topic.

It might sound stupid, but some of these sites are getting over [1 million unique visitors](http://siteanalytics.compete.com/fmylife.com+textsfromlastnight.com/) a month, and probably doing about $1 million a year in advertising revenue from it.

For example, [fmylife.com](http://www.fmylife.com) let's people submit funny one liners about how much their life sucks.  Users rate them or bury them based on how funny they are.

[TextsFromLastNight.com](http://www.textsfromlastnight.com/) does something similar with funny text messages you probably shouldn't have sent when you were drunk.

Juvenile?  Worthless?  Maybe, but they are also pulling an insane amount of traffic and dollars from these sites.

Two people I've talked to recently are starting similar sites.

The first is [TextsFromTheGame.com](http://www.TextsFromTheGame.com), a similar idea based around sports and all the trash talking that guys love to do.  These guys are just getting started so if you're a sports fan please help them out and go submit the best trash talk you've heard recently.  Also add "text at textsfromthegame.com" to your phone so you can easily forward them good ones you hear in the moment.

It's easy to forget these after the fact, so the idea is that when someone says something really funny you can shout out "that's going on textsfromthegame!" and forward it right there from your phone.

The other one is still being developed but it will be [exfiles.com](http://www.exfiles.com) (a great domain) and will feature short quips about, you guessed it, your crazy ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend.  Follow them on [twitter](http://twitter.com/exfiles/) or add your email to their website to get notified when it launches.

I have to say, these don't strike me "change the world" type of projects or see them as helping a ton of people.  But who knows, maybe making people laugh is all the value you need.

**What do you think?  Passing fad, or new way to build a big site with user-generated content?**

Until next time, keep breaking free!
