Stubling around the Internet often leads one to places and discoveries you'd never have otherwise. Recently on <a href="http://kottke.org" title="Kottke">kottke.org</a> there was a <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/10/rodrigo-y-gabriela" title="rodrigo-y-gabriela">posting</a> about a musical duo called "Rodrigo y Gabriela.

They play "thrash metal-influenced Latin percussive acoustic guitar." Which sounds incredible. The posting mentioned above has links to YouTube video of them playing, or you can click the iTunes store link below and grab your own copy.
