One habit, dare I say, tradition, when traveling by plane is to buy a cheesy paperback in the first airport and tote it around for the duration of the trip. My recent vacation to Oregon was no exception as I bought, and read, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tyrannosaur-Canyon-Douglas-J-Preston/dp/0765349655/sr=8-1/qid=1159545696/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-1512132-5913603?ie=UTF8&s=books" title="Tyrannosaur Canyon">Tyrannosaur Canyon</a></i> by Douglas Preston. As vacation fodder goes it was pretty good.

Rating: Light, fast-paced, and thick enough to last five days.
