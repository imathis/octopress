I've been having fun with a new site statistics package called <a href="http://shortstat.shauninman.com/" title="ShortStat">ShortStat</a> from <a href="http://shauninman.com/" title="Shaun Inman">Shaun Inman</a>. Not just a counter of hits, this slick PHP/MySQL combination shows me the browser breakdown of my visitors, and what country they are from. I can see search strings and pages viewed.

I know know that 48% of the "hits" to my site are from web crawlers, and that another 41% and Windows users; Macintosh holds in at 6%, with Linux right behind at 5%. The browser list includes several flavors of Internet Explorer, and several version of Firefox as well. Safari, Camino, Netscape, Konqueror, Lynx, and Mozilla round out the field. I've had visit from 18 countries including the Republic of Korea, Greece, Estonia, and the Czech Republic.

Very cool indeed.
