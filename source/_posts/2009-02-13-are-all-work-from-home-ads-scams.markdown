Got this message from a reader today:



> Hi Brian,
I just signed up to your blog and find it interesting and worthwhile to follow through. You come across as a knowledgeable person who doesn't mind to share your findings with anyone who asks and this Brian...as you know, brings instant credibility and builds a positive brand identity to your product and services. However I have a question which pertains to third parties products announced in your site. Do you check the legitimacy of those offers? Specially with so many "work from home" scams in the Internet nowadays. Wouldn't this compromise the trust you are building among your readers and subscribers to your blog?
Best,
E



Hi E,

Very valid question...and the answer is no, I don't check the legitimacy of the ads on my site.  And yes, I do believe that 99% of "work at home" ads on the internet ARE scams.  As a matter of policy, I personally do not buy anything sold on the internet with a typical long, hypish sales letter.  I find them annoying, actually.

So the banner ads which appear on the site I can't vouch for.  This probably does reduce the credibility of my website, but I also feel it's worthwhile to make money from it, so this is a tradeoff for me personally.  In many cases if people just click an ad, I get paid something, even if they have the good sense not to buy whatever the ad is selling.   I may reduce the number of ads in the future, especially if I see a better way to monetize the site.

All ads that run on Google Adwords aren't scams of course.  I have personally used them a number of times to market various things.  But for some reason, this particular industry of "make money at home" seems to attract a lot of losers so you have to be careful.  The world of internet marketing in general is not something I'd advise people to get too involved in.  There is something to be learned from all people (and I've learned a lot about marketing from reading various books, etc), but if you get too involved in it you can end up with a business you aren't proud of.

Here is an example of a website which uses good fundamentals of marketing (strong benefits, call to action, credibility indicators, lead capturing, testimonials, etc) and manages to keep it classy:

Now here is a site by someone who has gone to too many internet marketing seminars advertising a "work at home" product:

If you ever do see a product like that second one sold online, I'd advise you not to buy it.  Just remember, if those guys really were that rich, why would they need to create this silly product to sell online?  Wouldn't they have better things to do?

Anyway, you've caused me to do some soul searching with this question.  Maybe it is time to find some better monetization strategies or get rid of some ads.  I'll have to think on that one.  In the mean time, hopefully this was insightful - and if you'd like to avoid the ads, try subscribing to the [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/BreakingFree) which has hardly any.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
