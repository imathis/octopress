If you are at all unsure about where to vote, Google Maps can help.  Go to <a title="http://maps.google.com/vote " href="http://maps.google.com/vote ">http://maps.google.com/vote</a> and enter your street address and zip code to receive a map showing your home and your voting location, and localized information for your state and community.

This is an excellent community service by Google.
