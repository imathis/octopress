[![Engaging Readers In Discussion On Blogs](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/comments1231-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/comments1231.png)This is day 16 of my 30 day marketing challenge to get more readers on this website and make more money.  This is a live demonstration of how to [build a blog business](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/)!

Some of my contributing articles have started to appear, including part 2 of my [rss-to-email review of FeedBlitz](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/07/04/rss-to-email-comparison-review-feedblitz/), my [LifeHack.org article on why you need to be in Toastmasters](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/why-you-need-to-be-a-toastmaster.html) (it's a non profit group that teaches public speaking), and a similar (Toastmasters) article on [MindPetals.com (an entrepreneurship site)](http://mindpetals.com/blog/2007/07/five-reasons-all-entrepreneurs-should-join-toastmasters/).

Notice that I sent different articles on LifeHack.org and MindPetals.com, even though they were on similar topics.  The reason I did this was that both sites prefer unique content.  Google rewards unique content.  As an interesting side note, I've noticed that writing it once, and totally rewriting it again from scratch makes the second copy much better!  Can you tell which one was written second? ;)

My three marketing tasks for today are...



1. Trying to engage the readers in more conversation.  I'm starting to get quite a few comments on this site, and i spent this morning answering many of them.  I also got a phone call from very nice woman who had a question, and we talked at length.  I also got an interview request from [Simonne over at AllTipsAndTricks.com (a top 100k site)](http://alltipsandtricks.com/).  Finally, i sent an offer to talk on the phone to Joel at [JoelBadinas.com](http://joelbadinas.com/) since we seem to be on a similar path.  Connecting with more bloggers and providing a personal touch to the website as much as possible will really pay off I think.

2. I have an interview today at 4pm central on [Calling All Authors](http://www.globaltalkradio.com/shows/callingallauthors/) - a radio show through the people at Nightingale Press.  You can listen live online as I discuss my book and [how easy it is to start a business](http://www.globaltalkradio.com/live/index.asx).  I'll also post a recording of it in a few days in case you missed it.  Note that this interview is a result of some work I did many months ago.  A friend of mine who is an author recommended that website, and they were booked for four months, so I am just now appearing.

3. I watched [John Reese's latest video from Income.com](http://www.income.com/blog/2007/07/02/open-your-eyes-and-find-the-gold/).  He demonstrates a technique in which you can use [adwords](http://adwords.google.com) to see how much traffic your competitors are getting (at least the ones that use [adsense](http://adsense.google.com)), and then partner with the best ones.  Well, I did what John suggested and searched for sites related to starting a business.

Remarkably, the site with the most traffic was this little unassuming website called [WAHM.com](http://www.wahm.com/) (stands for work at home moms).  According to Google they get between 100-500 thousand page views per day!!!  Thats more than Entrepreneur.com, which is the website of Entrepreneur Magazine (it's very popular but is a pretty bad magazine by the way, subscribe to [Business 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0JGQO?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000P0JGQO) instead).

Anyway, I made an attempt to contact the owner of WAHM.com (Cheryl) by offering to create a video or article for them on how to quickly set up a business website.  Hopefully by offering value I can get in touch with them and get a partnership going.

The WAHM.com website is not professionally designed, and I never would have guessed they were getting so much traffic (they're easily earning $1000/day in Adsense alone I imagine).  Thanks John for the tip.
