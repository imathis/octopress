Earlier this week I discovered the <a href="http://www.travelpost.com/airport-wireless-internet.aspx" title="Airport Wireless Internet Access Guide">Airport Wireless Internet Access Guide</a>, which lists the availability of WiFi at all the major US airports. As luck would have it I am getting ready to fly this weekend and next for my vacation, so the list is timely.

Of course, only the two starting point airports offer free WiFi; both Kansas City International and Portland International are free. The two layover airports, Minneapolis and Houston, both charge for access; $6.95 and $9.95 respectively.

Obviously this is a conspiracy.

Sigh.
