Almost every day when I wake up I have music running through my head. Songs, well not so much songs and just refrains from songs, fill my head in the morning. Usually one song, repeated endlessly on my internal MP3 player. This morning is was "No One Is To Blame" by Howard Jones. I honestly can say that I haven't heard this song since it was popular in the early 80s. How it got into my head is beyond me.

Usually as the day progresses I am able to replace the tune with something else, or turn it off entirely. Other times I am forced to find a copy of the song and listen to it from start to finish to erase it from the playback loop. Thank God for the iTunes Music Store. Otherwise I'd still be listening to faintly remember lines from "No One Is To Blame" this afternoon.
