Here is a [great 20 minute talk](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/51) on weaning the US off oil.  Particularly intriguing is the idea that this could actually be hugely profitable (not government mandated).  Entrepreneurs in this sector will make a killing off of energy innovations in the next ten to twenty years.

P.S. If you aren't watching all of the TED talks, you're missing out.
