We had a quite day at home. It is still rainy outside. We've had nothing <b>but</b> rain for days now. Maybe we should be building an ark.

My brother and his family spent the day with Mom. My father is out west taking photographs and attending photo workshops. Michele and I are going to take Mom out for a belated Mother's day next Saturday. The fact that my brother refuses to invite us to family functions grates. We understand the reason why, but that doesn't make it any easier to stomach.
