<a title="Flunking Civics" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081120/od_afp/ushistoryeducationoffbeat">Yahoo! News</a> is reporting the results of a simple literacy test given to US government officials.  The results are dismal.  Elected government officials scored just 44% on average on the test which asks questions about history, economics, and civics.

You can take <a title="Civics quiz" href="http://www.americancivicliteracy.org/resources/quiz.aspx">the test</a> yourself.  I scored 27 out of 33 for 81.82%.
