While we were in Germany, Sibylle and I made good use of a small Internet Cafe in Winnenden, the town next to the village where we were staying.  The cafe had about a dozen mid-level desktop computers with 15 or 17 inch LCD monitors, and offered <i>miltch kaffee</i>, soft drinks, and beer.

The first time we sat down we discovered that the keyboards were quite a bit different than the English one we are used to in the States.  I'm not sure I can remember all the differences, but here is a partial list:

<ul>
<li class="il">The "Y" and "Z" keys are swapped in position.  Surprisingly many words require either a "Y" or a "Z" in them.  Particularly when your web site is yanshin. </li>
<li class="il">The "@" symbol is not Shift-2, but rather Ctrl-Alt-Q.</li>
<li class="il">The quote symbol (") isn't Shift-tic ('), but rather Shift-2</li>
<li class="il">There were a whole slew of German specific characters like ä, ö, ü, , and my favorite, ß.</li>
<li class="il">All the Germany symbols moved other punctuation keys around turning every day typing into a search-and-peck operation</li>
</ul>

Except for the <a href="http://www.zanshin.net/blogs/001332.html" title="Memory Card Infected">viruses infestation</a> on our camera's memory cards, the Internet Cafe experience was a good one, made all the more interesting by the differences in something as common and ordinary as a keyboard.
