Part of the reason I blog is to build [brand equity](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-build-brand-equity/).

Call me narcissistic, but I think it's important to control what comes up when someone Googles your name.  People decide all sorts of things about you by Googling you.  Business deals, speaking opportunities, and (if I cared about such things) getting a job can all be determined by your results in Google.

[![Loser Brian Gerard James](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/tnaqu81-150x150.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2008/10/tnaqu81.jpg)Until recently, what came up first in Google when I searched for "Brian Armstrong" was this clown.  A two bit, WWF wrestler named Brian Gerard James.

You got that right, he isn't even named "Brian Armstrong"!  Apparently that is one of his "ring names" along with "The Dark Secret" and "The Road Dogg" with two g's.  LOSER!  How lame does this guy have to be to STEAL my name (and Snoop Dogg's double g's) just to sound cool.  Everyone knows the WWF isn't even a real sport!

Anyway, this has been bothering me for some time.  And luckily, my day of reckoning has finally come because the last time I Googled my name, StartBreakingFree.com now ranks above the so called "Road Dogg" Brian Gerard James.

Good bye Mr. James, you just got a straight up "Google Piledriver" from the REAL Brian Armstrong.  If you even had a blog, my blog would kick it's ass.

What comes up when people Google YOUR name?
