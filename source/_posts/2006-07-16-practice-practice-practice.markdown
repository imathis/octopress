Through my martial arts background I learned the axiom, "Practice does not make perfect. Practice only makes permanent. Perfect practice makes perfect."

In dating, however, I think that practice of any sort is better than none at all. Never having been a big dater, and only having dated a few times in my life, I feel awkward and out-of-sorts in a date situation. I'm sure that my jitters come across in one form or another. Going out several times with different people will begin to ease my fears of the event, and I'll start to feel more comfortable. Which will be a good thing.

Besides, as was pointed out to me today, I can give my co-workers a hard time by dangling bits about all the women I'm going out with. Ha!
