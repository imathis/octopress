I have to credit my mother with instilling in me the importance of thank you notes from a young age.  As a young man I absolutely HATED writing my thank you notes after Christmas but she would still force me to do it.

I remember one year (I was about eight I think) I had put off writing them for as long as possible.  When she threatened some major action, I decided I would do it - but it would be in my own way.  I proceeded to write thank you notes to all my aunts and uncles explaining that although I truly WAS thankful for their gift, I was being forced under threat of punishment to write these thank you notes which really removed any true meaning from them.  I sealed up the envelopes and presented them to my mother to send off.  Needless to say she got some interesting phone calls from my aunts and uncles shortly thereafter :)

Anyway, while I still can't say that I ENJOY writing thank you notes - I do write them more often now and also see them as a valuable business tool.  I've used them on a number of occasions to make connections with people who otherwise would not have remembered me.  After all, a hand written thank you note is quite a rarity these days and takes only a second.  People often save them on a shelf at work which helps them remember you at some point in the future.  This can also be a great way to [get a mentor](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-get-a-good-mentor/) or get in touch with high profile people.

Anyway, I sometimes like to make my thank you notes stand out a little more by doing funny or weird things like drawing pictures or using my bizarre sense of humor.  Here are a few examples for you to check out.  Hopefully they inspire you to write your thank you notes if you haven't already!
