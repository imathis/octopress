Following up from my [post](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-make-buyersvote-com-easier-to-use-with-pictures/) a few weeks ago, I've made some big changes to [BuyersVote.com](http://buyersvote.com) to simplify it and make it easier to use.

Now, instead of adding each page individually with a long list of fields to fill out, it's possible to add an entire category with lots of pages in just two lines, right from the home page.

Much simpler, right? For example...

You don't need to have an account to do this (you'll see a [captcha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha) if you don't have one).

Here's what it creates: a page for the category (shown below) and a page for each individual item.

![Picture 10.png](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-10.png)

From here you can quickly vote items up or down.  The 1-10 rankings are now gone - only a simple +1 or -1 for each user is allowed - and the box simply shows the total number of votes that item has gotten. You can also add additional items if you've forgotten any (like Excel in the example below if you feel this is a valid option).

Clicking an individual item brings you to it's page, where you can write a more detailed review (instead of just voting up or down) and eventually see all reviews left by other users.

When you're all done, it might look something like this.

![Picture 13.png](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-13.png)

Now the important part happens: OTHER users can come to site and make their own votes, write their own reviews, and add other items to the category that you may not have known about.

![Picture 17](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2009/07/Picture-17.png)

Eventually, you will have a complete and accurate ranking of all personal finance software on the market!  (Note: this is just a hypothetical example and those aren't real reviews being shown.)

Compare this to the way it works now where you do a Google search for "personal finance software" and get nothing but subjective pages trying to sell you something.

Finally, it's worth mentioning that if you do want to create an account (it's required for voting, to keep it fair) you can still login with just two clicks and you DON'T need to create a new account to use BuyersVote.com! You can use an account your already have (like Google, Yahoo, Facebook, etc). This uses the very cool [OpenID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openid) technology.

I'm still finding things I'd like to tweak as I use it myself, and it will continue to evolve, but I'd really like to get YOUR feedback on what you like and what you don't.

**Please do me a favor and [click here to try it out](http://buyersvote.com)!  Create a new category if you've got a second.   I'd love to get your feedback in the comments below, and see how to make it better!**

Until next time, keep breaking free,
Brian Armstrong
