Starting with the beginning of the new year I have published something to zanshin.net every day. This is not to say that there has been new content everyday, rather there is a new posting published for each day of January. Twice now I've not gotten something up in time and had to back date the publish date.

I don't know how long daily publishing will last but for now it feels good to be devoting some time to my site again. Feel free to reply in the comments to this posting if there is anything in particular you'd like me to write about.
