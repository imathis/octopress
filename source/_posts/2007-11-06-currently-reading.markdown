There are always two or three or four books currently being read.  Here is the current crop:

<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pillars-Earth-Ken-Follett/dp/0451207149/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6749326-8913630?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194381332&sr=8-1" title="The Pillars of the Earth">The Pillars of the Earth</a></strong>
Originally published almost 20 years ago, this Ken Follet masterpiece takes place in 12th century England and centers around the building of a cathedral.  Somehow I missed this when it first came out.  Oddly enough, since purchasing this copy in Germany, he has published a sequel to the story.

<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/159059844X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6749326-8913630?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194381396&sr=1-1" title="Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager">Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager</a></strong>
I've been a huge fan of the author's <a href="http://randsinrepose.com" title="Rands In Repose">weblog</a> for years.  The book takes the stories and "messy thinking" there to new levels.  Highly recommended.

<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Crackdown-Disorder-Electronic-Frontier/dp/055356370X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6749326-8913630?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194381517&sr=1-1" title="The Hacker Crackdown">The Hacker Crackdown</a></strong>
While this book is now somewhat dated (it describes events and technologies in the early 1990s) it is still am interesting and compelling look at the Internet underground.

<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0618260587/ref=sr_1_6/002-6749326-8913630?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194381618&sr=1-6" title="The Fellowship of The Ring">The Fellowship of The Ring</a></strong>
It has been several years since I read the Lord of The Rings in its entirety.  Having the excellent movies by Peter Jackson is wonderful, but they aren't the same as reading Tolkien's word on paper.  Thanks to Sibylle, I'm able to read a beautifully illustrated hard bound copy.
