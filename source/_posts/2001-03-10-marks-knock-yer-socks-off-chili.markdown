2 stalks of celery finely chopped
1 med to large onion coarsely chopped
Â½ green pepper finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 clove elephant garlic, minced
1 pound ground beef
1 can diced tomatoes (28 oz)
1 can tomato sauce (28 oz)
1 small can tomato paste

olive oil

chili powder
cumin
cayenne (red pepper) powder
anise seed
salt
pepper
sugar
Worcestershire sauce

Heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large stew pot. Once it's hot add the onions, green                                  pepper and celery. Season with salt and pepper. Stir occasionally until the vegetable start to                                  soften. Remove them from the pot and add the ground beef. Brown the beef and crumble. Season                                  with salt and pepper. Once the meat is brown re-add the vegetables.

Add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir to mix well. Re-season with                                  more salt and pepper. Also add a pinch of sugar to cut the acid taste of the tomatoes.

I season without measuring so the following are just estimates. Experiment on your own                                  until it tastes the way you want. Be careful tho... it will take a while for the hot                                  flavors to become apparent, if you don't wait a while after adding spice to taste test                                  you can make it too hot to eat.

I generally start with a couple of tablespoons of chili powder. I almost always end up                                  adding more later.

I put several good shakes of Worcestershire in, maybe a tablespoon.

A couple, three shakes of cayenne and cumin. Add a dozen or so anise seeds. Sometimes                                  I toss a bay leaf in for grins.

Mix well and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat and simmer with the lid on for                                  several hours. Once your mouth is watering and you can't wait any longer serve and eat.
