It is rare these days that I find new music, from a new artist (new to me, any way) that I like enough to purchase. In the last decade I've only added four new artists to my listening rotation: <a title="Nanci Griffith" href="http://www.nancigriffith.com/" target="_blank">Nanci Griffith</a>, <a title="Evanescence" href="http://www.evanescence.com/" target="_blank">Evanescence</a>, <a title="Rodrigo y Gabriela" href="http://www.rodgab.com/" target="_blank">Rodrigo y Gabriela</a> and <a title="Loreena McKennitt" href="http://www.quinlanroad.com/" target="_blank">Loreena McKennitt</a>. A quick follow of those links will reveal that these artists cover a broad spectrum from contemporary country to Celtic-inspire folk, and from gothic rock to percussive guitar.

Today I added a fifth new artist and a new genre to my collection. <a title="Zoë Keating" href="http://www.zoekeating.com/" target="_blank">Zoë Keating</a> is an avant-cellist. She utilizes an acoustic cello, some pickups and microphones, some looping software on a MacBook Pro, and a foot pedal arrangement that allows her to interact with the software while she is playing. She explains her approach to music in this <a title="Wired: Zoë Keating interview" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6C1k5qer8k" target="_blank">Wired video article</a>.

The result is a sonic landscape that is layered and full of textures. You have never heard a cello played like this before. It is the most intoxicating music I've heard in a long, long time. The only thing that comes close is Rodrigo y Gabriela, whose percussive style is also unique in the guitar world.

There are any number of YouTube videos of Ms. Keating, but I highly recommend the Wired performance of <a title="Escape Artist" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYrcXX4nWOA" target="_blank">Escape Artist</a> to start.
