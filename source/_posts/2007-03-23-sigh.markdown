An absolutely fascinating thread about intellectual property rights, copyrights, trademarks, and theft of design work can be found over on Flickr. <br />
<br />
What started as a well-known and respected designer posting a screen capture of a thinly disguised copy of his logo being sold by another site has evolved into a huge thread about copyrights and intellectual property. It is well worth a (lengthy) read. The 43000 (and climbing) view count in just a couple of days shows just how powerful the Internet can be at leveling the playing field. <br />
