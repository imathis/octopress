I've been in [#Mandarin](irc://irc.freenode.net/#Mandarin) for quite a while. Due to popular demand from there, I've decided to write a guide on How to Sound Impressive in Mandarin.

# Introduction

Before I start, I have a warning:

    Attempting to sound more impressive than a native speaker while talking to that native speaker may result in the failure of your conversation as you realize that the guy beside you actually knows a lot more than you do.

Now that we've got over that, let's begin.

# Basics

To sound slightly more impressive, use less-used or more-locally-used synonyms.

This can be easily done with a [Google](https://www.google.com/) or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) search (for those in China, use [Baidu](http://www.baidu.com/), but I'm not sure why you need this guide anyways).

Here's a few examples:

* 谢谢 -> 感谢 (replace directly)
* For rhetorical questions, 难道 -> 岂 to make your already impressive-sounding rhetorical questions more impressive (replace directly)
* 再見 -> 告辭 (usage is different, check usage before attempting)
* 一点 -> 稍微 (replace directly)
* 很 -> 挺 (replace directly)

# Intermediate

To sound more impressive and convincing, use idioms.

* 笨蛋/白痴 -> 痴人说梦 (usage is *very* different, check usage before attempting)
* 

# Advanced

To ensure that no one actually understands you, throw in a couple of quotes from classical chinese literature.
