"Cutie with a bootie".

"Junk in the trunk".

These popular phrases spread throughout our culture like wildfire.  Why?

It has something to do with the repetitive sounds in the phrase.  It rhymes and is melodic.  Rappers have stumbled on an interesting psychological effect with phrases like these: they bounce around in your head and get stuck there.  They're impossible to forget!

It's not just rappers either.  Have you noticed that a lot of popular brands also have repetitive sounds?  How about Coca Cola (the 'c' sound), Google (the 'g' sound), or Toyota (the 't' sound).

Celebrities often change their names for a similar effect.  Marilyn Monroe, Jon Bon Jovi, and Chevy Chase are all examples.

It could be the vowel sound that repeats (assonance), the consonant sounds (consonance), or just the beginning letter (alliteration).

You can even win a trial by making sure "if the glove doesn't fit, you can't convict" is the last thing to stick in the jury's mind.

I've been trying to think of a slogan or description for my tutoring business which uses the same principles.  Super duper tutors?  Not sure, it's still a work in progress.

But what's clear is that repetition of sounds is a great marketing tool.

**What other examples can you think of?  More importantly, how can you use this in your own business to build your brand and stick in people's minds?  Brainstorm for a second and leave us a comment below!**
