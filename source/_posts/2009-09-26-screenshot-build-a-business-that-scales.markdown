It's inspiring to check out your Google Analytics stats sometimes.  Things go up and down naturally a bit each month, but as long as you're helping more people over time then it will be hard not to be successful.

According to Google, over 33,000 people used something that I built last month.  That's a drop in the bucket compared to many sites online but for me it still feels pretty good.  It's way more than I could have talked to in person, for example.

Remember, the only way to build wealth is to help other people.  If you want to earn more you have to either:



	
  1. provide something of greater value

	
  2. provide it to more people


Most people focus on #1 - for example, a doctor earns more than a barber.  When you need a heart transplant you really need it, whereas a haircut can wait.  There is almost no upper limit on the amount you'd be willing to pay to get a heart transplant done right (after all, what use is your money if you aren't around to spend it).  But a botched haircut isn't going to hurt much other than your social life for a few weeks.  The principle of scarcity is also at work here.  There are plenty of people qualified to cut hair but fewer who are qualified to perform heart surgery.  You could say there is a higher barrier to entry into that market (medical school, intelligence, etc).  So clearly, one way to earn more is to provide something of great value that people can't get anywhere else.

But I think it's a mistake to focus only on #1.  You miss out on scale.  Even if what you're providing is 100 times more valuable, you're limited in that you can only help a fixed number of people in a day (indeed, a doctor and a barber see about the same number of people in a day).  Technology is the key that allows you to scale.  It allows you to help not hundreds, but thousands or millions of times more people.  Now we're not talking doctor rich, we're talking Bill Gates rich.  Technology lets you [build a water wheel](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-secret-to-working-less-producing-more-and-getting-rich/) instead of carrying buckets.

Even if you are helping each individual person less, scale makes up for it.  Each of the 33,000 people who came to my websites in the last month probably only got a little bit of help (nothing like the value of a heart transplant).  But if next month 50,000 people used it or 50 million, it wouldn't take much more of my time and I would have drastically increased the amount of value I contributed to the world.  In other words, it scales.

There have been lots of technologies over the years that let people scale, and some of them still work.  Writing a book scales (you don't have to sit and tell it to each person, they can read it on their own).  Having a television program scales (whether 10 or 10 million people watch it doesn't change what you do).  But I think technology in the modern sense (specifically software and the internet) is perhaps the best one around today to get rich.  It's probably the one with the biggest untapped potential because it's the newest and still evolving.

So see if you can build something that helps people AND is scalable.  It's definitely more work up front to do that.  In the beginning maybe nobody will use it and you could have earned more giving haircuts.  But in the long run if you keep growing the number of people you help each month, then people will find a way to compensate you for it (whether it's flat out paying you, or clicking some ads, or whatever).  If there's no limit on the number of people you can help then there's no limit on how much you can earn.
