Here we are on Day 3 of my 30 day [challenge](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/16/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/) to bring more traffic to this website.

Today I:

1. Reinstalled [Linkmachine](http://www.linkmachine.net) which helps build reciprocal links (where you and another website link to each other to help improve search engine optimization).  I had it on my old website and hadn't ported it over yet to my new site.  Reciprocal links are important because they establish credibility with search engines.  I had a number of links on there to page rank 4 websites and better.

2. I set up a [Google Website Optimizer](http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer) test on my [book](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/?page_id=24) sales page.  I used [this plugin](http://websiteoptimizer.contentrobot.com/) for Wordpress which made it easier, although I'm still working out one bug with it.  Specifically, I'm testing the Guarantee section which promises a refund to see if I can improve it.  I'll continue to post results of these sort of tests over time.

3. Finally, I submitted this marketing challenge article series to [ProBlogger](http://www.problogger.net/) in the hopes that Darren will post a link to it.
