I don't know about you but I'm pretty glad the [House rejected the government's $700 billion dollar bailout](http://www.latimes.com/business/careers/work/la-fi-bailout30-2008sep30,0,6407711.story)....at least for now.

The Fed needs to focus on it's job of controlling the money supply and inflation and stop using OUR money to bail out failed companies.

$700 billion is a lot of money.  Do you realize there are only about 300 million people in the U.S.? I'm just guessing but maybe 200 million of those are 18 years or older and pay taxes.

**700 billion divided by 200 million = $3,500 per tax payer.**

You can [Google it](http://www.google.com/search?q=700+billion+divided+by+200+million&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) if your calculator doesn't have enough digits.

I've never had anything to do with Lehman Brothers, personally I'd rather keep my $3,500.  It's not like their customers will be left out in the cold.  Someone will come along and buy them up on the cheap.  It will be too good of a deal not too.  Lehman will be screwed (and they deserve it, they took the risks) but the economy as a whole will end up fine.  After all, people still needing banking services, and someone will be there to provide it.

What do you think, do you mind the government using $3,500 of your money to bail out some executives who made bad decisions?
