Snap Shots, those popup windows that give a preview of the target page of a link, are to my thinking highly annoying.  You can turn the feature off by visiting their FAQ and finding the link that leaves a cookie on your machine to disable the feature on any pages you visit.  Unfortunately, if you clear your cookies, you get the blasted preview windows again.

I can never remember where the FAQ link is at, so I am putting it <a href="http://real.snap.com/snapshots_faq.php" title="How to Turn the Bloody Thing Off">here</a> on my site for future reference.
