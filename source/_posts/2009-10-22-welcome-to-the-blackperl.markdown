My new MacBook Pro was delivered this morning, less then two-and-a-half days after it shipped from Shanghai China. It is stunning and sleek, simply beautiful. I am very pleased with my choice.

As some of you might have guessed from the title of this posting, I've named the new machine BlackPerl. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie <a title="Curse of the Black Pearl" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/" target="_blank">Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</a>, and particularly liked the bits about the pirate's code being more guidelines than rules. Anytime now when I hear the work guidelines used, mentally I say to myself, "They're more like guidelines, welcome to the Black Pearl." Typing the word pearl is difficult as I tend to spell it <a title="Perl - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl" target="_blank">perl</a>, which is the name of a powerful computer programming language. Sibylle pointed out that I was tending to spell Black Pearl, Black Perl, and the name stuck. I like the irony and the pun.

Migrating data, installing applications, and generally configuring the new laptop is now the order of the day. Probably the next several days.

Unboxing pictures will be up later this evening on <a title="MacBook Pro Flickr Set" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zanshin/sets/72157622620899086/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>, and over the next few days I'll have postings about setting the machine, and some performance comparisons with my venerable PowerBook. (By the way, my Powerbook has been on continuously for 40 days and 22 hours as I write this; not bad for a 7-year old computer that travels everyday.)
