I first learned of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Map-Steven-Johnson/dp/1594489254/sr=8-1/qid=1164649589/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-2598303-1862327?ie=UTF8&s=books" title="The Ghost Map">The Ghost Map</a></i> from a <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/10/the-ghost-map" title="The Ghost Map">posting</a> on <a href="http://kottke.org" title="Kottke">Kottke</a>. Once the book was released I picked up a copy and read it from cover to cover. It is a thoroughly fascinating look at science, myth, cities, disease, and people. Steven Johnson is rapidly becoming the Tracy Kidder or John McPhee of my generation.
