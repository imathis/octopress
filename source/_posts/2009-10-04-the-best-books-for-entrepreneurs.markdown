Sometimes I post up [reviews](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-generate-word-of-mouth-for-your-business/) of books I've enjoyed.

But I think it'd be interesting to get a collective approach from all the readers of this blog.  What books on business have had the greatest impact on you?  Which book do you find yourself recommending to other entrepreneurs the most?

A bunch of suggestions have already been added to BuyersVote.com.  What would you add or subtract?  You can [check out the list here](http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-books-for-entrepreneurs-reviews) to add your two cents.

In case you've never used BuyersVote.com before, here is a quick review of how it works (it's really simple):



	
  * If you like an item, vote it up (+1)

	
  * If you don't like an item, vote it down (-1)

	
  * If you have a better idea, add it at the bottom


You'll have to [login](http://buyersvote.com/user_session/new) to vote (sorry, that is the only way I could find to keep voting fair), but you can use your Google account or one you already have so there is no registration process.

This isn't really related, but another category that I put together recently on BuyersVote is for the [best halloween costume ideas of 2009](http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-halloween-costume-ideas-2009-reviews).

As you can see, some of them are good, some are bad (maybe even offensive).  But this is the beauty of crowd sourced data.  Good ideas get pushed to the top and bad ideas get pushed down (with enough participants).

I actually have an ulterior motive for this category: I'm hoping to get on the first page of Google for keywords related to Halloween costume ideas this season!  There will obviously be quite a bit of traffic over the next month for those keywords and, if it works, some new people will be introduced to BuyersVote that wouldn't have otherwise seen it.  This is a nice little marketing technique that you might want to try: target a highly specific seasonal keyword.  If you can get on the first page of Google for it, you might be able to ride a nice wave of traffic that few other people are competing for.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
