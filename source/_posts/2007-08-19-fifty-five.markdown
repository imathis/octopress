This morning when I got on the scale my weight was 195.2.  I've now lost fifty-five pounds.  55. <em>Fünfundfünfzig</em>.

That's eleven 5-pound sacks of potatoes. It's five 10-pound sacks with a 5-pounder thrown in for good measure. It's a seven year-old child.

What is truly amazing about that number is that I carried it around with me all the time.  Going to the store and holding eleven 5-pound sacks of potatoes is impressive in itself.  Carrying those eleven sacks around all the time, even in a harness to distribute the weight, is tiring even to think about.  Since I've started losing weight I've noticed less knee pain, I have less trouble sleeping, I've stopped snoring, and I generally feel better.

Fifty-five pounds.  Wow.
