Over the weekend I visited the body shop recommended by Lexus and received an estimate to repair the front bumper. As it turns out, the bracket that holds the destroyed fog lamp in place is part of the bumper, and since it was snapped off in the accident, there is no way to replace just the light.

Actually the bumper is only a few dollars more expensive than the light assembly. The lamp is 217.52 and the bumper another 254.98. Toss in some paint (bumpers are white and have to be painted), and labor to disassemble and reassemble the car and you are looking at $984.75. All for one paperback book sized hunk of cement.

The insurance company is picking up the tab for 2-days of car rental, so after I pay my $500 deductable, their total will be $544. Happy happy.
