For those in Houston, I'll be speaking at the Double Tree Hotel (5353 Westheimer, One block west of the Galleria) this Tuesday from 6-8pm at the After Hours Network.

The talk will be titled Fire Your Boss and Double Your Income and will include...




  * 10 simple tips you can implement in the next week that will get you on the path toward financial freedom running your own business

  * How you can get 3 of the top ten books ever written on building wealth for free

  * Real life case studies of how you can test out any business idea for about $100 in a month to see if it works


I'll also be at the SCORE Small Business Owner's conference on Wednesday April 23, 2008 in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas.

Hope to see you at one of these events!
Brian
