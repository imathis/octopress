Contrary to recent indications, this space is not intentionally left blank. The code I was using to structure my new site layout breaks under some browsers, most especially Camino.

I have discovered the offending script and removed it from the main page, however, the other pages of my site are still corrupt. Hopefully by this evening I'll have those pages cleaned up as well.

This is a list of the known viewing problems:

<strong>Windows IE 5.5 SP2</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Right side div follows center div rather than appearing along side as designed</li>
	<li>Comment image is inline with post title</li>
	<li>Bottom div spacing wrong due to Right div problem</li>
</ul>
<strong>Camino 0.7</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Only index.html page is viewable due to script problem on all other pages</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mac IE 5.2</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Right side div follows center div rather than appearing along side as designed</li>
	<li>Bottom div spacing wrong due to Right div problem</li>
</ul>
If you are using another browser and you see what you think is a formatting problem, please let me know. Thanks!
