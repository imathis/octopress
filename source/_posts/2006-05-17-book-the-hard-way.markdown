Lee Child continues his Jack Reacher series with <i> <a href="http://ereader.com/product/detail/21996?book=The%5FHard%5FWay%3A%5FA%5FJack%5FReacher%5FNovel" title="The Hard Way">The Hard Way</a></i>. While the books are fairly formula and have predictable plots, they are a good read.

Rating: Several hours of escapist fantasy
