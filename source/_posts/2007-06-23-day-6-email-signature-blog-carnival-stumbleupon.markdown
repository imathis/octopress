[![Email signature in Gmail](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-2221-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-2221.png)It's day 6 of my 30 day [challenge](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/16/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/) to bring more traffic to this website.

Here is what I did today:

1. Added an email signature to my outgoing emails. (see picture)  I send a lot of emails each day, so hopefully this will reach some new people.  As will all good marketing, I tried to include a benefit to the reader to get them to take action (in this case, click the link).

2. I submitted an article to [BlogCarnival](http://blogcarnival.com) so that it could be included in one of their pages.  BlogCarnival is a website where people compile lists of related blog posts into more useful collections.

3. I submitted a link to this post series on building traffic to [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/), which is another Web2.0 site with lots of traffic.  Once they approve my link, I'll probably spend $50 to drive 1000 hits to the site (5 cents per click) and see how many convert to subscribers.
