As seen on <a href="http://zeldman.com/" title="Jeffrey Zeldman">The Daily Report</a>, <a href="http://www.fontifier.com" title="Fontifier.com">Fontifier</a> is a free (for now) service that converts a scanned GIF of your handwriting into a True Type font.

Once you are at the <a href="http://www.fontifier.com" title="Fontifier.com">Fontifier</a> page, click on the numbered steps and follow the directions to create your own font. In my initial attempt I didn't scale the template to the full size of the page, and I didn't make the letters as large as possible. The result, while still very cool, isn't readable below about 14 points. Next time I'll know better. Be warned that the service is getting used a lot; I had to reload each step several times to finally get through the process.

It would be more useful if the template allowed you to write each of the 102 characters on the keyboard, but for typical writing this font works very well.
