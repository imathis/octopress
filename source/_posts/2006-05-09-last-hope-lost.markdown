As expected the oncologist discontinued my mother's chemotherapy today. The regimen was only killing her blood and not impacting the tumor. Or should I say tumors, as the latest CAT scan revealed at least two.

The transition to hospice begins now, perhaps with slight detours for radiation treatments to ameliorate pain. No one knows how long she will remain alive now.

Time is both precious and cruel.
