[![Google Translations On My Website](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/japanesewebite1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/japanesewebite1.png)It's day 25 of my 30 day marketing challenge to demonstrate that anyone can start a blog, and it can be a [profitable and inexpensive home based business to start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

Today I went to a [free marketing class at the University of Houston](http://www.small-business-consultants.net/small_business_resource/Internet_marketing_clinic.htm#class-schedule) taught by Dick Myers and Jay Mock.  I couldn't believe how much useful information I got.  I've been reading a ton about internet marketing, especially lately, so I thought I knew it all.  But these guys had some great ideas that I haven't seen talked about elsewhere.

Jay runs an [outdoor lighting and light fixture](http://www.residential-landscape-lighting-design.com/) store that gets a staggering amount of traffic.  Dick Myers also has an excellent [Internet Marketing Blog](http://www.small-business-consultants.net/blogs/) that you should check out.

All three ideas for today came from the presentation.  I'll probably go back each week.



### 1. Translation



Using [Google's Translation service](http://www.google.com/translate_t) I was able to get my entire website translated into 8 languages!  Check out the collection of flags in the sidebar on the right.  Here's how...



Here is the code I used that you can paste into your own website.  Note that you will have to find and replace "www.startbreakingfree.com" with your own domain for it to work.  I had to modify the code [here](http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/11/add-google-translation-flags-to-your.html) because I couldn't get it to work on my site.

[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/img/43/1633/320/13539953_0384ccecf9.jpg)](http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com%2F&hl=en&ie=UTF8&langpair=en%7Cit)
[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/img/43/1633/320/13539966_0d09b410b5.jpg)](http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com%2F&hl=en&ie=UTF8&langpair=en%7Cpt)  
[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/img/43/1633/320/13539946_2fabed0dbf.jpg)](http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com%2F&hl=en&ie=UTF8&langpair=en%7Ces)
[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/img/43/1633/320/13539955_925e6683c8.jpg)](http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com%2F&hl=en&ie=UTF8&langpair=en%7Cja)
[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/img/43/1633/320/13539958_3c3b482c95.jpg)](http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com%2F&hl=en&ie=UTF8&langpair=en%7Cko)
[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/img/43/1633/320/14324441_5ca5ce3423.jpg)](http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.startbreakingfree.com%2F&hl=en&ie=UTF8&langpair=en%7Czh-CN)

I wanted to find a place to put those flags closer to the top of the page, but I couldn't think of a good place.

This is great because supposedly, 65% of people on the internet speak a language other than English.  This dramatically increases the reach of this blog!  I image that while most internet users speak at least some English, this will allow them to get more out of it in their native language.



### 2. Setting Up Access For Mobile Devices




> Researchers at IDC say that 1.3 billion people will connect to the Internet via mobile phones by 2008.



[![Cell Phone Emulator](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/cellphoneemulator1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/cellphoneemulator1.png)Want to see what your website looks like in someone's mobile device, like their cell phone?  Check out this [emulator](http://emulator.mtld.mobi/emulator.php).

This will also greatly increase the reach of the website.  I used [WordPress Mobile Edition](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/readme?project=wordpress-mobile-edition), a plugin by Alex King, to get it up and running.  It took about 2 minutes to install and bam, I have a mobile version of this website.  Man I love WordPress and all the plugins people have made for it.  I have about 30 installed now.
  




### 3. Submitting to RSS Directores



[![RSS Directories - Great Places to Submit Your Blog](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/blog-directories1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/blog-directories1.png)Based on Jay's advice (and the presentation of one other gentleman, who's name I can't remember).  I decided to submit my site a a bunch of [blog directories](http://www.toprankblog.com/rss-blog-directories/).

This took a long time but it should generate a lot of back links, because these sites will pull your feed and hopefully create webpages from it that contains your links.

I'd encourage anyone reading this to try and find a similar class or club in your area.  Just getting around all those people who were doing what I've been trying to do was amazing.  I left feeling really inspired and excited (and got 3 killer ideas).  That high can be more motivating than any other thing you do.
