With an average weekly commute of two hundred miles, not to mention excursions for groceries, dining out, and trips to Illinois, the set of tires I purchased two years ago are worn out. I'm not into the wear indicators, yet, but the wear is uneven enough that the car has started pulling to the left at highway speeds.

Time for new tread.

Calling all the usual suspects yesterday morning I kept getting the same answer: $820. Finally I called <a href="http://www.tiresplus.com/" title="Tires Plus">Tire Plus</a>, described my need and got the same price quote. When I remarked that his price was no better than his competition, he immediately offered to give me a tire for free if I made an appointment with him to have the tires done.

Sold.

He "lost" $150 in this sale, but gained a customer. Good deal for both of us.
