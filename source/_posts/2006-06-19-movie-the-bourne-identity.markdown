Ever since I was a teenager I've been reading Robert Ludlum's books. The best one was the <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553260111/sr=8-2/qid=1150763291/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-2628588-9950523?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="The Bourne Identity">The Bourne Identity</a></i>. Ludlum's books are dense with plot twists and rich with detail, most are hundreds of pages long. Obviously the movie <i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0258463/" title="The Bourne Identity">The Bourne Identity</a></i> bears only a passing resemblance to the original story. Still it is a well crafty and surprisingly good movie.

Rating: One of the few movies I can re-watch again and again.
