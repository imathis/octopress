I was reading [this presentation by the Dropbox.com Founder](http://bit.ly/9x5THt), Drew Houston, the other day and the most interesting part about it was that most of their marketing with Adwords and conventional approaches completely failed.

Yet Dropbox has over 4 million users.  So how did they do it?

Apparently it was almost entirely word of mouth - but they did it in a smart way.

You can click above to see the full set of slides (they are worth reading).  But one important point that stood out to me was the 2-sided incentive for referrals that he mentioned above.

I logged in to Dropbox to see what it looked like and here it is:

The key here is that he is giving them more **storage** as the reward and not **money**.  I like this for a few reasons:



	
  1. It's closer to what Dropbox users actually want.

	
  2. It's cheaper for Dropbox to give this away because they are dealing in trade.


It's sort of like if you ask your friend to give you a ride to the airport, and when you get there you pull out your wallet and give him $10.  He'd probably feel insulted - it cheapens the act of kindness.  But if you give him a ride the next time he needs one, or return the favor in some other way that isn't money, then it's all good.

Sometimes money isn't the best gift.

So with this in mind I started thinking about how I could improve my own site, [UniversityTutor](http://www.universitytutor.com).  My current referral program pays tutors $3/month to refer other tutors.  But those other tutors not only have to signup, they also have to upgrade - which only 1-2% of them do.  So it's tough for tutors to make much doing this, and $3 isn't very motivating.

This weekend I took a few hours to change UniversityTutor's referral program to more of a Dropbox model.  The free account on UniversityTutor is based on the number of job requests you get (first 3 are free, after that you can upgrade) instead of storage like Dropbox.  So now when a tutor refers a friend they both get another free job request up to a maximum of 20.

It will be interesting to see if this is more effective than money.  My hunch is that it will be - when tutors reach the end of their free account, the conversation in their head is much more around how to get more tutoring jobs, not how to get $3.  What do you think?

Until next time, keep breaking free!
