I'm on a long weekend in Illinois to see family and friends. After the numerous visits I made last spring and early this summer I have needed some time away, needed some time not spent in the car driving seven hundred plus miles round trip in three days.

Last spring I was in Chicago for a holy union ceremony and was able to spend a couple of days with one of my very best friends. Together we briefly visited a third old and very good friend. Except for weddings and such, the three of us haven't been together just for being together's sake in far too long. Active live styles and geographic distance have conspired against us, that is until now. Saturday the three of us are going to spend the day hanging out together.

I am very much looking forward to catching up on their lives, and on sharing what is new and good in mine. These two men are my oldest friends - they've known me for over a quarter century and we've all watched each other go through the twists and turns life's path presents.

It'll be good.
