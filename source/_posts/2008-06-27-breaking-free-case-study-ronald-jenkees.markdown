In [Breaking Free](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/) I outline a number of ways that people can generate passive income to forever leave their jobs.  And as you know I always like to see new examples of that...

Well I recently stumbled across [this YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smE-uIljiGo) of a guy named Ronald Jenkees and it struck me how the internet has really made breaking free that much easier.

Ronald is just an "average" guy in small town America who happened to really enjoy playing music.  A while back he started [posting videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/ronaldjenkees) of some of the beats he was coming up with.  He also came up with a [blog](http://www.ronaldjenkees.com/) to share some of the challenges he was facing composing music.  Eventually he put together a [CD](http://www.ronaldjenkees.com/music-store/) of some of his work.

Apparently people liked his videos on Youtube and felt a genuine connection with him, because at last count he has over 33,000 subscribers to his videos and his work has been viewed by over 2 million people.  I don't have exact figures, but apparently his CD is selling quite well.

All this with little more than his personal time invested and probably a few hundred bucks in equipment.

By the way, music sales are a perfect example of passive income because it doesn't require [your personal time](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/helping-individual-people-cant-make-you-rich/) for each person to benefit from it.

**The internet is the great equalizer.  People with talent or something interesting to say now get free distribution to the world.  You no longer have to "get discovered" by some music exec in LA or New York.  A kid in a tiny town in Kentucky can reach the whole world.**

Even if you aren't a musician, you can apply the same principle.  Find something you enjoy or are passionate about.  Share your experience or journey to learn it.  Offer some value to other people.  Build a list of people who are interested in what you have to say.

This will NOT happen overnight.  If Ronald had started his blog to "get rich quick" it most certainly would not have worked, and I'd be willing to bet that for the first few years (perhaps longer) he saw little or no results from it.  He kept doing it because it was something he enjoyed whether other people noticed or not.  This is key.  As they say, it takes 7 years to become an "overnight success", so pick something you enjoy doing.

Here is a sample of [one of his videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smE-uIljiGo).  I happen to really like his music...make sure to check out his CD.
