I have a lot to be thankful for in my life. I am in love with a wonderful, vivacious, beautiful, passionate woman who is in love with me. I have a job that is rewarding and provides the means to have a comfortable life.

As I have grown older I have matured emotionally and spiritually. I have achieved a certain balance physically, emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually. I feel integrated and whole. My enjoyment of life has increased tenfold in the past few years.

I am comforted knowing that I can face the demons I still have; the tools I have developed emotionally and spiritually will allow me to reach a place of balance with those parts of me that still create noise in my head.

I am closer to my family in a real way than ever before. I am able to be myself without worrying about their feelings. I see them as people now, and I can like them for themselves.

I have learned how to relax and live life for today. I have discovered my true pace and, for the most part, I am able to move through life at that speed and not the world's ever-increasing frenetic pace.

I have learned how to like myself for who I am.
