Efficiency is not your friend. At least not when you have an entire day to fill and you are depressed. In the three hours since I've been up I have:

<ul>
<li class="il">brushed my teeth</li>
<li class="il">had breakfast out at IHOP (eggs, hash browns, pancakes, OJ)</li>
<li class="il">bought groceries (stuff for chili, stuff for dirty rice, Compound-W)</li>
<li class="il">made chili (diced the veggies, browned the meat, combined everything, and left it to simmer all day)</li>
<li class="il">showered and shaved</li>
<li class="il">wrote this posting</li>
</ul>

Now what? I've got 12, maybe 13, hours to kill before I can reasonably go to bed. Maybe a movie, that'd kill 2 or 3 hours. More if I picked a theater that was farther away. I went window shopping at the book store last evening. I could repeat that at the electronics store today.

At least tomorrow I've got 9 or 10 hours of work to fill the time.
