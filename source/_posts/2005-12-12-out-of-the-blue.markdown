Today, quite out of the blue, I received an offer to purchase my domain name. I've had zanshin.net registered since February 1996; i.e., this site will be ten years old in just a few weeks.

I really don't know what to think about the offer as I've never considered <em>not</em> having zanshin as my domain. My initial reaction is that it would be far to weird to not have it; besides I'm finally getting some good traffic to the site, and my google rank is growing, and zanshin.net is the number one result returned when you google my name.

Having just lost Michele, who came into my life ten years ago this month, I don't think I'm in the mood to part with another, huge part of myself. For now anyway, I'll be declining the offer.
