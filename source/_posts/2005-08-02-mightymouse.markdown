Leave it to Apple to reinvent the mouse. One button looks with multi-button functionality is what the new "<a href="http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/index.html" title="MightyMouse">MightyMouse</a>" from Apple promises. While I am not a fan of corded input devices, and have transitioned away from using a mouse altogether on my PowerBook, I am very tempted to buy this mouse.
