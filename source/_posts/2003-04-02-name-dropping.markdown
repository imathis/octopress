I have updated the elsewhere list over there to your right. The list of sites that I visit daily is more or less represented here now. (I did eliminate the commercial sites, these are just the personal sites.) I am inspired by the look and feel of these sites, and also by their content. Sharing bits of myself is easier when I see others sharing of themselves.

Give 'em a try. Who knows, you may like what you find.
