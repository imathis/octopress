After reading about <a href="http://www.markallan.co.uk/clamXav/index.php?page=dl" title="ClamXav">ClamXav</a> I thought I'd download it and give it a try.

Like most "<a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/" title="Switchers">Switchers</a> I brought with me a whole host of documents, images, music, and zip files. Turns out that there were some parasites in and among the collection.

While my machine maybe safe from the viruses of the Windows world (unless I run one while inside of VirtualPC), I can still pass them on to my friends. Sort of a Typhoid Macintosh situation.

After nearly three years on Mac OS X, with no anti-virus software of any sort running, I am pleased that the newest virus found was on a file in a zip archive from 1998.
