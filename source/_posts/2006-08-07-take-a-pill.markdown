The final piece of my weight adjustment program is taking daily supplements. Since I am eating less, and doing more, I am giving my body conflicting messages. I'm also starving it of necessary nutrients simply through less food consumed.

My friend Pete recommended the "Men's Pack" from Walgreens, so I have added them to my routine. It has Vitamin E, Selenium, Vitamin C, a B-Complex, and a  Multivitamin.

Unlike the weight lifting or the kendo, which has visible results, I'm not sure I'll be able to measure the difference from taking the supplements. But I am willing to believe they will make a difference.
