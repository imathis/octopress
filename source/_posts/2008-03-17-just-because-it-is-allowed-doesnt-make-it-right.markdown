It <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/news/2008/03/republicans_turning_out_in_dro_1.html" title="Republicans Voting for Clinton">appears that Republicans are voting for Hillary Clinton</a> in late season primaries in order to either prolong the divisive contest between her and fellow Democratic candidate Barack Obama, or to outright boost her to  the nomination.  The strategy is based on their belief that Senator Clinton can be defeated by John McCain in November.

This tactic is certainly within the legal boundaries of the primary/nomination process in place; something that doesn't make it any more palatable.   Personally I find the idea abhorrent and against the spirit of the whole process.  It deepens my resolve that we need a single, <a href="http://zanshin.net/2007/11/16/primary-day/" title="Primary Day">national primary</a> rather than months of scattered voting.
