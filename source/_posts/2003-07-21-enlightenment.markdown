Many years ago when I was first developing this site I stumbled across a book called "Creating Killer Web Sites." Despite the hyperbole in the title it sparked an interest in web design that lasts to this day.

Today I am reading a new book, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/dwws/" target="_blank">"Designing with Web Standards"</a> by Jeffery Zeldman. It is fantastic. I haven't even finished it and already I am looking at my site and starting to make changes.

Get it. Read it. Attain Oneness with the One True Way in a Blinding Flash of Enlightenment.
