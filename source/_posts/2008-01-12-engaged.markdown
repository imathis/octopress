While we were in Germany last fall, I proposed to Sibylle on her birthday.  She joyfully said yes.

Shortly before Christmas, while doing some shopping at Legends, we saw a pair of rings we both liked.  We kept looking but that pair continued to stand out in our minds.

Today, while in Manhattan so Sibylle could teach a few lessons, we visited Zales again.  Once again we were drawn to the same pair of rings.  After a few moments thought, and some questions to the jeweler, we bought the rings.

We are both very happy.
