If you are subscribed by email and have seen some strange problems lately, I apologize.  It is my fault.

In the process of switching to FeedBlitz as our newsletter provider, there have been some difficulties.  I think FeedBlitz could improve their interface here and there, but ultimately it's my fault for not making you the readers aware of the changes.  So please bear with me as I get them worked out.

More companies could probably avoid disaster and improve customer relations with that simple phrase: "I apologize, that is my fault".
