Heres a cool business idea someone could take a stab at: sell gas mileage bumper stickers.

Everyone is in such a big huff about gas prices these days, why not throw some fuel on the fire.

Come up with some symbol that is simple and easily recognizable.  (Sort of like the Jesus fish people put on their cars.)

It could be a [gas gauge with a little needle](http://www.michaelgass.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/MG_gas_gauge_box.51195109_std.jpg), or a symbol of the earth on fire, or a polar bear on a melting iceberg, or a gas pump or whatever.

Simpler would be better probably.  Then people could come to your website and get a custom one made for their car.  So for example if you had a Prius you could order one like this:

It would be totally honor system and people could put any number they want.  I think it could become a matter of pride to see who could get the highest number.  You gotta have over 50 to be cool, and lying about your mileage number is way uncool.

What would be really fun is if there was a backlash movement.  Sort of like the Darwin fishes that came out with the little feet on them as a backlash to the Jesus fishes.

If you had a big ole truck or gas guzzler, then you could get one like this:

Or one that said "liberal wheenies" or whatever you wanted.  Of course this battle would all be good for business on your website.

I'd say you could probably start this business and test out the idea for less than $100.  Throw up a [wordpress website](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/a-new-business-website-from-start-to-finish-in-4-hours/), use [paypal](http://www.paypal.com) or [google checkout](http://checkout.google.com) to create a "buy now" button, do a little bit of SEO or pay per click to bring in customers, and find some company to produce and drop ship the product for you so that you have zero inventory.

Remember, great business ideas are all around you and are there for the taking.  Its people who take ACTION on those ideas that are the real rarity.

Until next time, keep breaking free!

P.S. Extra credit if you find a way to put your URL in the bumper sticker somewhere for free advertising.  This could help it go viral.  You'd have to make it really small or unobtrusive though so it doesn't distract from the main purpose....or make it free to get one with your url in it and pay for one without?  Not sure, but it has some potential.
