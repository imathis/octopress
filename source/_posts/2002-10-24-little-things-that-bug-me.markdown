Why do restuarants find it necessary to play music constantly in the background? When I go out to eat I want to enjoy my food, and the conversation with my companion. I don't want to have to yell over the too loud music. This is a case where just because we can doesn't mean we should.

And if you are going to force me to listen to music, please select something other than angry grunge music. I wouldn't listen to that atonal crap in my home, why should I have to pay for the experience?

<hr width="25%" />This note is to all service people who deal directly with the public. I admire you all for taking on a job that forces you to have contact with people who may or may not be pleasant. Your job is one at which I could never be successful. However, please don't call me 'honey', 'hon', or 'dear'. I prefer 'sir.' I am <strong>not</strong> your hon. Got it? Thanks, <em>dear</em>.
