Interview game: THE RULES
1. Leave a comment, saying you want to be interviewed.
2. I will respond; I'll ask you five questions.
3. You'll update your website with my five questions, and your five answers.
4. You'll include this explanation.
5. You'll ask other people five questions when they want to be interviewed.


<a href="http://www.hchamp.com/" title="heather champ">Heather Champ</a> gave me these questions:
1. If you could travel back in time, what would you tell yourself 10 years ago?
I'm not sure that I'd tell myself anything 10 years ago. You see it will only be 9 years this December that my wife and I met for the first time, online in an AOL chat room. I'd be afraid of disturbing that event. At most I'd tell my 10-year younger self to stop chasing after the perfect job and focus more on building a life outside of work.


2. Sweet or sour?
Sweet.


3. What is your dream car?
I always wanted a Triumph Spitfire. I'd settle for any recent car that was fully paid for. I've had a continuous car payment since 1984. Eek! Let's see:
36 months @ $188/month equals $6768  ('84 Pontiac Fiero)
48 months @ $225/month equals $10800 ('87 Honda Prelude)
36 months @ $335/month equals $12060 ('91 Mazda Najavo)
42 months @ $390/month equals $16380 ('94 BMW 318i lease)
08 months @ $450/month equals $3600 ('91 Lexus ES300)
12 months @ $750/month equals $9000 ('91 Lexus ES300 + 2000 Nissan Altima)
18 months @ $600/month equals $10800 ('00 Lexus ES300)
30 months @ $1100/month equals $33000 ('00 Lexus ES300 + 2001 Audi TT lease)
13 months @$850/month equals $11050 ('01 Lexus LS430)

Or $113,458. Oh. My. God.


4. Who is Deep Throat?
Linda Lovelace suffered under that unfortunate title. In political circles s/he is the mysterious underground parking lot denizen who provided Woodward and Bernstien information they needed to expose the Watergate coverup. While speculation runs rampant at to their true identify I personally think it was a senior aide, someone with access to information but overlooked since they weren't really a player.


5. You wake up one morning and a new tattoo adorns your chest.
   What does it say?
"Do not try this at home, I am a professional" Or a ying-yang symbol.
