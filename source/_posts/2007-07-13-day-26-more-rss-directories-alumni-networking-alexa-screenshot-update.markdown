[![Rice University Alumni Meeting](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/ricealum1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/ricealum1.png)This is day 26 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new readers to this website and demonstrate that [blogging can be a profitable and inexpensive to start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

My three tasks for the day were...



### 1. Added This Website To More RSS Directories



I finished submitting to the [pages on this list](http://www.toprankblog.com/rss-blog-directories/).  There were a lot and it took a long time.



### 2. I Attended A Business Networking Event For Rice University Alumni



This was a great event to meet people of all ages from my university, [Rice](http://www.rice.edu).  Some had graduated this year, and some had graduated 40 years ago.  This was a good chance to use my [business cards](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-17-posted-interview-audio-faster-server-and-new-business-cards/).




	
  * I followed up with a number of people by email, and included my link in the email.

	
  * I made a contact with one guy who is in the business of helping others start companies.  There is a potential for partnering here in a number of contexts.



Take advantage of your universities networking groups!





### 3. Updated the Alexa Screenshot



The Alexa screenshot of the blog was out of date, showing my old site before it was even a blog.  Since this image is used by Technorati, BlogCatalog, and others, it was important to get it right.

It was easy to to, just check out this [Alexa Submission Form](http://thumbnails.alexa.com/update_thumbnail).
