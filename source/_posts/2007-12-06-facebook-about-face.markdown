It seems that the furor over the Beacon advertising framework in Facebook as finally reached a tipping point.  Reversing an earlier statement, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/" title="Bit Blog New York Times">Mark Zuckerberg has apologized</a> and Facebook now allows members to completely opt out of the Beacon "feature."

I'm not sure if this is enough given the <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9051119&intsrc=hm_ts_head" title="Facebook caves to criticism">negative attention</a> this has brought the service.

The new "opt out" settings only determine whether information collected by Beacon is displayed on Facebook, <i>not whether that information is collected</i>.  In other words, your activities on participating sites is still collected and sent to Facebook's servers.  Facebook hasn't jumped the shark at all, they are about to be <a href="http://techland.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2007/12/04/rip-facebook/" title="RIP Facebook">devoured by a shark</a> of their own creation.

I'm out and I intended to stay out.
