<p>前一段时间看到的这个视频吧，这首歌叫 <em>Invisible </em>，听起来不错，用在这里也比较合适的（歌词上只有一点不太合适），呵呵。</p>

<p>YouTube 上我给了 5 颗星，大家看看吧。</p>

<p>其实小哀非常かわいい，另一种可爱吧，呵呵。</p>

<p>（不过最终柯南还是要跟 Ran 在一起吧。作者回复评论也说："Eh he's most likely going to (end up with Ran). It would shock EVERYONE if he didn't lol"）</p>

<p>我发现我越来越喜欢哀了，呵呵。</p>

<p><strong>祝 Ai 找到自己的幸福。</strong></p>

<p>引一句歌词吧：
<blockquote>And you just see right through me but if you only knew me<br />
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable<br />
Instead of just invisible</blockquote>
（建议大家到<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWDeh-rK0qY">原链接</a>看看评论，也不错。）</p>

<p>最后是歌词全文：
<pre>She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me</pre></p>

<p>[Chorus:]<br />
And I just wanna show you<br />
She don't even know you<br />
She's never gonna love you like I want to<br />
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me<br />
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable<br />
Instead of just invisible</p>

<p>There's a fire inside of you<br />
That can't help but shine through<br />
She's never gonna see the light<br />
No matter what you do<br />
And all I think about is how to make you think of me<br />
And everything that we could be</p>

<p>[Chorus:]<br />
And I just wanna show you<br />
She don't even know you<br />
She's never gonna love you like I want to<br />
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me<br />
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable<br />
Instead of just invisible</p>

<p>Like shadows in a faded light<br />
Oh we're invisible<br />
I just wanna open your eyes<br />
And make you realize</p>

<p>[Chorus:]<br />
I just wanna show you<br />
She don't even know you<br />
Baby let me love you let me want you<br />
You just see right through me<br />
But if you only knew me<br />
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable<br />
Instead of just invisible</p>

<p>(Oh ho...yea)</p>

<p>She can't see the way your eyes<br />
Light up when you smile</p>
