The State Police here have an unmarked Mustang they use for speeding ticket revenue generation. From a distance you can't tell this is a police car. Even up close it is hard to tell, the license plate is not a special government one and there is only one extra antenna. I've seen it in action a couple of times so I know what it looks like. This saved me the other day.

Coming home from work I go past the lake and local zoo. The road follows the shoreline so it is curvy and fun to drive. The Audi TT hugs the corners like it is on rails and it is fun to drive, um, aggressively. Last evening I was approaching the curve by the zoo when all of a sudden here was the red-and-white mustang glued to my bumper. We were at the bottom of a slight hill and I was going maybe 7 or 8 miles an hour over the posted 45. From that point on I stayed glued to the limit.

The cop stayed glued to my bumper, even tailgating. I got the impression he was trying to provoke me into speeding. As I turned onto the country road that leads to our house he followed. Just before our house the speed limit drops 10 miles an hour, as I slowed for that he got very close, again trying to push me I think. I could almost hear his frustration when I put my signal on and slowed to a crawl to enter our driveway. I stop at the end of our lane to get the mail. As I got out of the car the Mustang was already far down the road, accelerating far past the limit.

We don't live in a police state, for which I am grateful. However, I wish someone would tell Officer Speed that
