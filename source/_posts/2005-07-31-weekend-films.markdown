We didn't watch as many movies this weekend as usual, but we did see a couple of good ones.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0029843/" title="The Adventures of Robin Hood">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a></strong>
The original Errol Flynn version, campy, over-acted and under rated. Even with Kevin Costner's wooden performing style I prefer the newer one to this one, but it's worth seeing.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0068646/" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></strong>
Your collection is not complete unless you have this masterpiece. The chilling decent into darkness portrayed by Al Pacino is stunning. Maybe the best movie even in my opinion.
