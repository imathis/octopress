Lately I've been starting to think about things I want to do, projects with my websites, cleaning out the storage lockers, or cleaning this apartment. Thinking about things to do is as far as I get before indifference and apathy take over. Being indifferent is actually a good thing in this case, as it means I don't have the spark to get down on myself about not following through.

Thinking about things I want to do is a bit of an improvement. Until recently I was just operating on autopilot. Don't expect a new look-and-feel for zanshin.net any time soon, but I have been looking at the last partial redesign and thinking I should apply it here. I am also feeling the urge to dust off the long neglected Partition Software site, perhaps even converting it to a two-column format with development related blog entries on one side and static Partition Software information on the other side.

But first I think I'll go to bed and get some sleep. Being up at 3:30 this morning has made me bone tired on top of not really having any ambition. Never a good combination.
