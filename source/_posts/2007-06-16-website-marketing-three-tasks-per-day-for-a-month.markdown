[![analytics.gif](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/analytics1-150x150.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/analytics1.gif)In [Breaking Free](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/?page_id=24) I list seven great business ideas that can be started for under $100, and blogging is one of them.  I intend to put my money where my mouth is and demonstrate that live in front of you, quickly turning this into a profitable website.

So I've decided to do a little marketing challenge to help build traffic.  Each day for the next 30 days, I will complete at least 3 tasks to market this website.  My goal is to build traffic, get more subscribers, and sell books....but more importantly it is to prove that anyone can make a profitable website with a little dedication.

This challenge is in the spirit of Steve Pavlina's [30 days to success](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/) and [Journey Page](http://www.journeypage.com/).  It also follows with the idea of making goals measurable and timely (having a deadline) which great authors have been talking about for years.

Each day I'll post about what was done.  How much can be accomplished in a month?  We shall see.

There is absolutely no shortage of tasks to work from.  For starters, I'll be doing some SEO, taking some ideas from [Problogger](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/08/15/search-engine-optimization-for-blogs/), this [ebook](http://www.authorityblackbook.com/reese/) on traffic building, and many others sources.  Suggestions are always welcome.

The first day of the challenge will be today, Saturday the 16th of June, 2007.  The challenge will end the 16th of July, 2007.  Let the games begin!
