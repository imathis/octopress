Here is some excellent business education for the day.  Much cheaper than getting an MBA.

In this talk, Milton Friedman gives an overview of free market economics, including how...




	
  * The minimum wage law is discriminatory

	
  * The cost of social security is born 100% by the employee

	
  * Every social program has had the opposite of the intended effect

Why this stuff isn't taught in school I have no idea (I actually have a degree in economics and we never learned anything as useful as this).
