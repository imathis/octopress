When <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunt-October-Jack-Ryan-Novels/dp/0425133516/sr=8-2/qid=1163735848/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/102-3248367-9722548?ie=UTF8&s=books" title="The Hunt For Red October">The Hunt For Red October</a></i> was first released my best friend from high school, who was in the Navy, serving on a nuclear fast attack boat, told me about it and said I should read it. Based on his recommendation I bought a hard back copy that I still have today. The politics and world situation are different today, so the story line doesn't have the same impact as it did in the early 1980s, but it is still a very good book.

Rating: Worth re-reading if only to see how things once were
