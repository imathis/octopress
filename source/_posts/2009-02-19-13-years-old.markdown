Zanshin.net will be thirteen years old tomorrow. I know that when I first got the domain I never imagined I would still be actively hosting a web site more than a decade later. The oldest blog postings go back to December 1999, so I've been archiving my life for almost a decade here.

Happy Birthday, Zanshin, and many happy returns.
