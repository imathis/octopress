As I transition from being a consultant to being an employee again there are some obvious changes occurring, and some that aren't obvious. The best analogy I can think of is the difference between high school and college. In high school you are told what to do, where to go, and made to toe the line at every turn. You can't even wander in the hallway during class without a pass.

In college you are entirely on your own. Some professors may take an interest in their best students, but it is possible to drift along unseen and unmonitored. As an employee you have policy and procedures to follow. Lines and boxes. It's a good thing, mostly; it results in a safety net of sorts. Consulting is operating without that net. You agree to a riskier way of working and in return you get a higher reward.

I've been without the net for a decade. It feels good to have one in place again.
