Last weekend I took a day trip to Tigre, Argentina which is a little town on a river delta about an hour outside Buenos Aires. I went with some people who live in the same house, and met some new people along the way. It has nice boat trips, restaurants, and some boardwalk/themepark type stuff.

It was a fun outing. I looked at some tourist packages that charged $75 or $100 USD to take a trip to Tigre. But my Argentine friends said it was a waste of money and i should just take the train and get a boat when I got there.

They turned out to be right. The train ticket was a whopping 1.35 pesos (or 36 cents USD) and the boat ride was 18 pesos (less than 5 USD). Glad I didn't take that "tour" for Americans!

Here is some [video I shot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pb3KCQc9q4):

**Update On UniversityTutor.com**

My transition back to the old business model of monthly subscribers is now complete. I've already started to recover some subscribers. I'm split testing 2 price points right now of $9.95 per month or $89.95 per year vs $5 per month or $45 per year. I'll report back the results on that after a few months collecting data.

It feels good to be back on track with that - the [water wheel](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-secret-to-working-less-producing-more-and-getting-rich/) is running again! To transition I simply put together an email for all tutors. Nobody was upset by the change like last time and the response has largely been positive.

My next goal will be to get UniversityTutor going in some more countries. I'm going to start with English speaking countries first because it's a major amount of work to internationalize a website into a bunch of languages. But there are still plenty of places to start (England, Canada, Australia, large parts of Europe, etc).

I'll then probably do another marketing round to university students there.

First step will be to import this [huge free database of cities](http://www.maxmind.com/app/worldcities) around the world (thanks to MaxMind.com for open sourcing it). This will help with the SEO for each new city so that a page is created for all tutors who sign up there.

Sometimes it's easy to take things for granted and forget how good you have it. This morning I had to pinch myself. If I had been following the "normal" life plan I'd have woken up at 7AM this morning and gone do a job I probably hated. Instead I woke up at noon in Buenos Aires and went to work for myself.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
