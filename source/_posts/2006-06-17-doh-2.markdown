Earlier this week I used an "Old El Paso" taco kit to make, oddly enough, tacos. The outside of the box hinted that free iTunes songs could be had within. Sure enough, printed on one flap inside the box is a code good for one download.

This morning I rounded out the John Sandford "<a href="http://www.johnsandford.org/prey16x1.html" title="Lucas Davenport top 100 Songs of the Rock Era">Lucas Davenport top 100 Songs of the Rock Era</a>" playlist I've been building by getting the last 12 or so songs I needed. Did I happen to remember to use my free download coupon?

Of course not.
