About a year ago I walked into the local [SCORE](http://www.score.org/) office in Houston and was very impressed.  I waited only a few minutes for my appointment (which I'd made on their website) and was soon sitting across from an elderly retired gentleman in full suit & tie who was once the CEO of his own large successful company with over 100 employees (before he sold it and retired).  We talked for several hours, he listened to my good ideas and my bad, was respectful and asked lots of questions, and occasionally offered sage like advice.

After this we kept in touch by email, I can go back for more meetings whenever I wanted (he volunteered about one day per week) and it was all free.

SCORE is an outstanding and under utilized resource for would be entrepreneurs.  The volunteers are all former entrepreneurs themselves - which you know if you've been reading this blog for a while is very important to me.  [You should only get advice from people who have actually accomplished what you're trying to do](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/interview-with-a-self-made-millionaire-steve-davis/)!

Whether you have an existing business, or have no idea where to start, SCORE is highly recommended.  If you are lucky enough to live in a city where they have an office, do yourself a favor and go make an appointment right now: [http://www.score.org](http://www.score.org/)

> Old version: work hard (for a very long time), achieve success, earn freedom (to retire and do all the things you missed out on while you were working)

New version: find work that affords you freedom = success
