The latest in the Lincoln Rhyme series, <i><a href="http://ereader.com/product/detail/19494?book=The_Twelfth_Card:_A_Lincoln_Rhyme_Novel" title="The Twelfth Card">The Twelfth Card</a></i> is a good suspense/thriller. There are a couple of nice misdirections and plot twists to keep you guessing.

Rating: Good page turner
