We are going to hawaii in December for Christmas. Three years ago we spent Christmas by ourselves after having travelled to see my family at Thanksgiving, and my wife's mother the weekend before Christmas. Michele was sick with pneumonia from Christmas until late january, and didn't fully recover until months later.

The following year, the holidays were spent with my family. This past year we went to Tampa to see Michele's old stomping grounds.

This coming year Christmas is for us and us alone. I'm sure that we'll see some of my family (as then all live within an hour's drive) before going. But the main thrust of the season this year is on us.
