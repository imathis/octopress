[![Passive Income](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/831441_relaxing_at_the_beach1-150x150.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/831441_relaxing_at_the_beach1.jpg)I like to think a lot about passive income.  That's the ultimate dream right?  To just travel the world, focus on whatever you feel like, and pick up a check each month from your investments or business.

Robert Kiyosaki makes a great point about this in [Cash Flow Quadrant](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446677477?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0446677477) (aff), as have many other authors, that just because you're self-employed it doesn't mean you are financially free.  Many entrepreneurs end up buying themselves a job - sure they don't have a boss, but they are still putting in 10-12 hours per day.  (Typical examples include shop owners, or businesses where you are the primary talent, like consultants, etc).

But, I'm starting to realize that it's not a clear answer most of the time whether income is passive or not.  It typically exists along a spectrum, and I like to find out where it is on the spectrum by asking this question: **If you were to disappear to Tahiti, how long would you continue to earn money?**

Here are some examples along the spectrum...



	
  * **A blue collar job** - only paid when you clock in, you don't get paid for even 1 minute you aren't there.

	
  * **A white collar job** - you could sneak in late or take a long lunch (a few hours), but you also get time off for sick leave, and vacation...so a few weeks in some cases

	
  * **Mom & Pop shop owner** - You've got to be there each day to open and to close, so typically no more than a day or two if you can get someone to cover for you.


  * **Mom & Pop shop owner with management (or kids)** - once they get management, they make a lot less money, but could potentially disappear for a few weeks to a month.  The problem is that if you leave for much longer than that, the business will start to deteriorate.  Theft, dirt & grime, laziness of employees, etc start to creep in.  Only what's measured gets done.


  * **Self-employed business owner** - this is like my tutoring business...it would continue to earn money for a month or so if I disappeared, but income would steadily decline as I wasn't bringing in new clients, sending paychecks, etc.

	
  * **Owning real estate that you manage yourself** - Could last six months probably without you doing anything, but it may not be prudent to do so.  Tenants would call with repairs, could miss rent, etc.  Some upkeep is required.

	
  * **Owning real estate with a management company** - Could disappear for a year or so and the checks would continue to come in.  You may need to be called once in a while for massive repairs, lawsuits, or insurance claims (fairly rare events).

	
  * **Passive investor** - As a passive investor (think large appartment buildings, shopping centers, hedgefunds, REITS, stocks, LLC's, LLP's, etc)  you could literally disappear for several years, having never seen the business, and you wouldn't need to feel guilty.  It's someone else's job to manage the project day to day.

	
  * **Handing all your money to a financial planner** - again, several years.



This is part of the reason I'm transitioning more and more into real estate right now (it has other factors like rate of return and tax benefits that I think make it better than stocks or typical financial planner type investments too).

Some of the mentors I'm working with own apartment complexes that they literally haven't been to in years.  They don't have a key to the place.  They wouldn't even know how to get on the property if they had to.  Their phone number isn't listed on any registry of people to call.  And that's exactly how they want it!

**How long could you disappear from you current (or ideal) job, and continue to earn money?**
