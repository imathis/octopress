On this day of thanks giving here in the US I am truly thankful. I am healthy, happy, and glad to be alive. While the past year has been filled with challenges it has also been filled with good.

I hope that all of you are with family, friends, or the people who are most important in your life. Further that you can tell them, one and all, that they are important to you.

Happy Thanksgiving!
