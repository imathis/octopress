Scott Adam's has a great post out today on how [teamwork can hurt your productivity](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/teamwork/).

I personally despise working in teams and rarely if ever do it.

If I need to get something done:



	
  * Outsource it to a contractor


If I need to figure out what to do:

	
  * Brainstorm it with select mentors and friends


"Friends" also includes making a blog post and getting feedback from people that way.

It's better to be the sole decision maker on any project.  Otherwise too much time is lost in keeping everyone on the team up to date and making sure their feelings don't get hurt.

It's also much more efficient to not have to justify your ideas to other people and try to convince them.  If I'm convinced, or I think someone has given me some good advice, I just start working on it right away without delay.

I think it's a mistake to ever say "hey can you two be in charge of XYZ?"  If you watch [The City](http://www.mtv.com/videos/the-city-ep-11-fool-me-twice-shame-on-me/1605864/playlist.jhtml) or The Apprentice you've seen examples of this gone wrong.  The same is true in planning a birthday party or night on the town.  Pick one person to be in charge or you'll get drama, not results.

What do you think about teamwork?
