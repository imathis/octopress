Yesterday I [posted](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/my-website-improved-14-changing-one-sentence/) about how I used Google WSO and changed one sentence to get a 14% improvement on my business website.

In case you are wondering how to use it on your own website, here is a great [video from Google](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZlGy2auvFo&eurl=http://www.shoemoney.com/&feature=player_embedded) about how to use WSO:



The video makes it look easy but in my experience it's definitely not simple to use (very uncharacteristic for a Google product).  This is especially true for dynamically generated websites like my own where I frequently don't have plain text that I'd like to test - it's dynamically generated.  I've been [talking with some Google folks](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/websiteoptimizer/thread?fid=11a2583205f65b910004617c680b0028&hl=en) about this and they seem very responsive on improving it.

**So what do you think I should test next on [my site](http://www.universitytutor.com/)?  Suggestions?**

I have a few ideas for suggestions that I'll be posting about over the next few weeks.
