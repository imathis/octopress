Like most of the continental United States we were caught up in the major winter storm system over the past two days. We were right at the western edge of the worst of it, I think, so we didn't get much snow, but we do have icy conditions as the storm started with freezing rain.

Air temperatures were down to about 2ยบ this morning and are forecast to be -12ยบ tomorrow morning. Thus far our house has weathered the storm fairly well with one exception - there's frost on the ceiling in both front (north-facing) bedrooms.

We've contacted the builder and are waiting to find out what's covered in the warranty and, perhaps more importantly, what can be done to prevent this from happening in the future. There's at least one storm like this one every winter - with strong winds, blowing snow, and bitter cold temperatures - and we don't want this to be a recurring "feature" of the house. Moisture like this left unchecked can develop into far nastier problems like mold.

I have to keep telling myself that it's a new house, not a perfect house.

Sigh.
