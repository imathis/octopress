I originally posted about this album <a href="http://www.zanshin.net/blogs/000709.html" title="From A Distance">a while back</a>, specifically her rendition of <i>From A Distance</i> which still soothes the ache in my heart when I hear it.

Now I want to say that the entire album is outstanding. I never would have believed that I would enjoy a country (admittedly cosmopolitan country) so much, but I do. You will too. Get it via the iTunes Music Store link below.
