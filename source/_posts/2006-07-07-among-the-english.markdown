In the movie <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0090329/" title="Witness">Witness</a></em>, at the end as John Book is getting ready to leave the Amish world and return to his own, Eli Lapp says to him, "You be careful out there among the English." As both Michele and I loved the movie this phrase became part of our lexicon. When ever one of us was going somewhere alone the other would quite often say, "You be careful out there among the English."

In my post-Michele world I have stayed close to home, not just physically but emotionally and philosophically as well. Knowing that still waters, while running deep, also can become stagnant, I've taken one or two small steps towards returning to the larger world outside. In effect I am going out among the English.

I'm not prepared to discuss details just yet, but I am moving forward -- I've stirred up the water to see where it goes.
