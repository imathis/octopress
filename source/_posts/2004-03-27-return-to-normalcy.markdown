Today, for the most part has been a return to normalcy. We made a western omelet this morning that was delicious. This afternoon we baked a yellow cake and frosted it with homemade chocolate frosting. We watched favorite programs off the Tivo, and a slow movie called "Between Strangers."

It was a day filled with normal Saturday things. For a few hours the reality of our situation was set aside and we got to live again. I'm hoping for a repeat tomorrow. We're making a batch of our homemade spaghetti sauce.
