Today marks the two year anniversary of my employment here in Kansas City. Saying that the past two years have been tumultuous would be a massive understatement. If, as Nietzsche said, "That which does not kill you will only make you stronger", then I am stronger today than I've ever been in my life.

In the last two years I have moved, survived two major staffing reductions on my project, sold a house I loved for a loss, incurred debt that will take me another three years to pay off, lost my mother to lung cancer, and lost my wife to depression. I've been battered and beaten down again and again by the vagaries of life, and yet I'm still standing. There is a core of strength in me that hasn't been tapped out. I've heard it said that God never gives you more than you can handle. If that is true, I'd wish he'd stop trusting me so much.

I have no clue what the next two years will bring my way. Heck, I don't know what this afternoon will bring. I'm still here, and I'm still moving forward, so I guess my journey through this lifetime isn't over.
