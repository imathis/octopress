Spike Lee's latest movie is wonderfully put together and beautifully acted. With a nod to the ultimate bank heist film, <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i> and a twist or two to keep you guessing, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0454848/" title="Inside Man">Inside Man</a> does not disappoint.

Rating: See it the theaters, and then rent it when the DVD is released.
