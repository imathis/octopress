In just over a month (December 6 - January 10) I've had 500 unique visitors to this site view 941 pages. This may not sound like a lot, but for a weblog that is largely the emotional ramblings of a middle-aged philosopher-hacker, I think this is a rather nice number.

The new statistics are a truer measure of zanshin.net's readers as only browsers are counted. The various software robots that crawl the web indexing what they find are still coming here, they just aren't getting counted. Zanshin easily receives 200 "hits" a day when you factor in all the automated visitors. While my ego prefers the higher number, my sensibilities are happier with the truer figure.
