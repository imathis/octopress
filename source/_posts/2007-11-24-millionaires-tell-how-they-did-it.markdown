Thanks to Anjali for sending in this article where four millionaires are [interviewed about how they got rich](http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/RetirementandWills/RetireInStyle/MillionairesTellHowTheyDidIt.aspx).

The most striking thing to me (aside from the fact that 3 out of 4 quit their jobs to do it) is that they all persevered through incredible odds and difficult times.  They wanted it so badly they decided to just never give up.
