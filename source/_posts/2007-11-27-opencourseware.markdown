I had read about MIT's <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm" title="OpenCourseWare">OpenCourseWare</a> some time ago, but I had never followed up on the knowledge.  Last night, in a fit of inspiration, I did a Google search and then started browsing the course offerings.  After just a few minutes I settled on MIT 6.092, which is an introduction to Java Programming.

Although I have been involved in object-oriented programming, as well as object-orient analysis and design, for the past ten years, I am not a proficient Java developer.  I get by, but I don't consider myself a Java coder.  I want to change that.  So, <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-092January--IAP--2006/CourseHome/index.htm" title="Java Preparation for 6.170">MIT 6.092</a>, to be followed by <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-170Fall-2005/CourseHome/index.htm" title="Laboratory in Software Engineering">6.170</a>.  And maybe <a href=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-171Fall2003/CourseHome/index.htm" title="Software Engineering for Web Applications">6.171</a>.

You are never too old to learn new tricks.
