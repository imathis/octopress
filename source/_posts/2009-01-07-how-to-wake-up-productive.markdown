Want to make sure you accomplish your goals in 2009?  Well [Eben Pagan](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/productivity) has a new video out that is pretty good.

Eben is a very impressive entrepreneur who has built several multi-million dollar companies.  I've listened and read probably about 100 hours of his material.  Some of them three or four times.

Click play to watch hist latest video below.  You can enter your email to watch the second part if you'd like which has the good stuff (it's free).

Some of the best take aways I've gotten from this type of thinking are to:



	
  1. Work for uninterrupted periods of at least 1.5 hours.  I now ROUTINELY turn off my phone and email while working which is something I never did before.

	
  2. I have uninstalled ALL chat programs and turned off Google Chat within Gmail unless I have a specific meeting with someone.  Interruptions are the #1 enemy (watch the video to find out why).

	
  3. I keep a paper todo list at all time on the right side of my computer and each day I pick the single most important task to get done for the day and try to do it FIRST.

	
  4. I pick a task that will actually get me the best results and progress in my business - whereas before I would often pick the easiest or quickest task first.  I now routinely ask myself a very important question: Am I being busy right now or productive?



This type of stuff has been great for me and allowed me to get a lot more done in 2008 when I read through it.  If I had to make a list of the business mentors I look up to the most - Eben Pagan would honestly be in the top five.  As I said above I've listened or read through literally a ton of his stuff (some of it multiple times).

Anyway, [check out the video here](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/productivity) and enter you email to get the 2nd part.  His Wake Up Productive program isn't cheap but he gives away a ton of really good advice for free even if you don't want to buy it.
