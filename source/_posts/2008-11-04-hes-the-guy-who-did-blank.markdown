Do you realize how many doors that simple phrase can open for you?

Everything - from meetings with important people to free press any time you launch a new project - is yours if you're known for something that people love.

So how do you do it?  Start publishing your ideas.  You need distribution.

In Ben Franklin's time, distribution was expensive.  Now all you need is a blog, a YouTube video, or a self published book to get started.  It's free, what are you waiting for?
