On our drive between Manhattan and Olathe we pass a prominent Billboard that asks the question,
<blockquote>Why is Stihl not sold at Lowe's or Home Depot?</blockquote>
And it includes a picture of a chain saw.  Every time we go past it I think to myself that I need to Google the question to find out the answer.  Finally today, I remembered.

Turns out that Stihl feels their product is <a title="Too Good For Lowe's or Home Depot" href="http://www.brandkeys.com/news/press/072406.WSJ.Lowes.pdf" target="_blank">better served by the chain of nearly 8000 independent</a> retailers than by a large home improvement chain.  I though it might be a labor or liability issue.

On the subject of not selling your product in certain outlets to maintain an image, <a title="Daring Fireball" href="http://daringfireball.net" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a> has a link today about <a title="The Man Who Said &quot;No&quot; to Walmart" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/node/54763/print" target="_blank">Snapper Mowers pulling their product from Walmart</a>.
