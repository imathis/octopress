Once upon a time, a long time ago, in a land far, far away I worked for a YMCA summer camp. In a week's time I could teach 8-10 eight year olds the following:

One hen
Two ducks
Three squawking geese
Four limerick oysters
Five corpulent porpoises
Six pairs of Don Alverzo's tweezers
Seven thousand Macedonians in full battle array
Eight brass monkeys from the ancient sacred crypts of Egypt
Nine sympathetic, apathetic, diabetic old men on roller skates
and
Ten lyrical, spherical denizens of the deep, who haul quay around the corner, and quiver all at the same time

Then I'd send them home with mom or dad with instructions to teach them the same verse. I just thought you should know.
