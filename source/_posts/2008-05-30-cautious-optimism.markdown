We are hopeful that Nekko's episode with insulin shock was an isolated event.  Since Tuesday we have closely monitored her eating and insulin, and haven't seen any evidence of another bottoming out like Sibylle caught that day.

For her part, Nekko, seems to be normal again.  She still displays some aggressiveness around our food, needing to be shooed away from an unattended plate, but nothing that causes any concern.  If anything she is more approachable in the aftermath of Tuesday's episode.  

In a little less than two weeks we'll have another day long glucose curve performed, and hopefully learn more about the current state of her diabetes.  Until then, we'll be watchful and cautiously optimistic.
