Things are calmer here than they have been for a while. My employment situation seems to have taken a turn for the better. While nothing is guaranteed all indications are I will be staying for at least another year. A new administration comes into power in January and my hope is that the financial situation next spring won't be as dire as it was this past spring.

I've learned a lot about my self as a result of the past few weeks of stress and upset. It has been a great growing experience, however, it is one I hope I don't need to repeat.

My wife and I are celebrating our 5th Wedding Anniversary tomorrow. Our time together has been magical, wondrous, and filled with laughter and love. Neither of us can believe it has been 5 years already. The honeymoon isn't over yet. I have been extremely fortunate in that I married my best friend, my true companion, and my perfect lover. We have had to work very hard at our relationship; nothing good is ever easy or free. The work has been rewarding personally and as a couple. There is no one I would rather spend time with than Michele, and no one I want to be closer to than her. I would marry her again in a minute because I love her more deeply today than I did 5 years ago when I said, "I do."
