I recently put up a [project on 99Designs.com](http://99designs.com/web-design/contests/universitytutor-needs-designer-love-47652) to get UniversityTutor redesigned.

I put up a $795 prize and got [46 entries](http://99designs.com/web-design/contests/universitytutor-needs-designer-love-47652) from a half dozen designers

Most of the designs weren't very good, but one designer stood out and I awarded him the prize.  His name is [Jack Herbert](http://jackherbert.com/) and he is in the UK.  Below you can see the screenshots of his final design which I selected.

These are just photoshop images right now, so I'm spending the <del>evening</del> next few days turning them into CSS on the real site.  It should be launching soon.

Main takeaway: **there is just no reason not to have a decent design for your web business these days**.  For a reasonable price you can get some great design work done.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
