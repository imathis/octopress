My little corner of the Internet is fifteen today. A quick whois lookup of zanshin.net shows that this domain was first registered at 05:00:00 GMT on 1996-02-20. I did have a personal site for about a year or so prior to having a domain. I think I was one of the first private domains my Internet provider had ever set up.

There have been a lot of bytes over the modem since then.
