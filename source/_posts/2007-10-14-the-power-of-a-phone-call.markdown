This afternoon, after returning from a grocery shopping trip, we discovered that the power was out.  A quick trip down the side walk confirmed that it wasn't just us, the entire complex was in the dark.  Knowing that others had likely already called, I wanted to call anyway, just so I would feel like I had done something about the situation.

Using the laptop and my wireless broadband card I was able to look up the number for Kansas City Power & Light.  I called and entered our phone number only to have the automated system tell me that, "no account matched that phone number."  Then Sibylle reminded me that we don't have KCP&L anymore, we have Weststar now.

She ran upstairs and got the last billing statement, which had the "report an outage" phone number listed.  I called that number and entered our account number.  The automated system told me that the outage had been recorded and that based on historical records, we could expect the power to be restored within 1 1/2 to 3 hours.

No sooner had I repeated this information to Sibylle than the lights came on again.  The power of a phone call.
