In the classic musical <em>You're a Good Man Charlie Brown</em>, there's a song about writing a book report about Peter Rabbit. I forget who sings it now (and I'm too lazy to open a new browser tab to find out via Google) but I do remember that the report was supposed to be 500 words long. The singer writes a little bit and then starts counting the words.

Tonight's posting is a bit like that report. It's 11:23 pm and I haven't written anything all day so you are getting this rather flimsy excuse for a posting just so I won't miss a day.

And now you can all go look up <em>You're A Good Man Charlie Brown</em>.
