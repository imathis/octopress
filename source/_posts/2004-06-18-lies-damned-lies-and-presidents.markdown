President Johnson lied about an attack in the Tonkin Gulf and escalated the United States' involvement in Vietnam ultimately resulting in the deaths of 3,000,000 or more Vietnamese, and over 55,000 Americans.

President Nixon lied about an attempt to break into Democratic National Headquarters and ultimately resigned from office rather than face impeachment.

President Ford was, and still is, the only man to hold the office of president without benefit of an election.

President Carter had the great misfortune to hold office when the US installed government in Iran was toppled, and Americans were held hostage for over 400 days.

President Reagan lied about arms for hostage deals, and generally aided and abetted the massacre of thousands of citizens in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Haiti.

President Bush I rode a wave of popularity after building a world wide coalition to oust Iraq from Kuwait. Luckily he wasn't able to get himself re-elected.

President Clinton lied about having sex and was impeached by the House of Representatives.

President Bush II lied about the imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, in a State of the Union Address, over saw the worst attack on American soil in history, lied about a connection between Iraq and al Qaeda, refuses to acknowledge solders who died in his illegal war off occupation in Iraq. And he continues to lie in the face of the 9/11 Commissions report finding <em>no</em> connection between Iraq and al Qaeda.

And what is scarier than the history of our Presidents is the fact that the conservative arm of the Republican party now control 28 governorships, a majority of state legislatures, the US House, and the US Senate. And they aren't going away.
