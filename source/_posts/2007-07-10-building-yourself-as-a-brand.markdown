![Seth Godin](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/resizephp1.jpeg)It's amazing what you can do once you have a following and you are a brand.  For example, [you can decide to answer some questions one day and earn $50 grand](http://www.squidoo.com/daylongseminar/).  That's part of the reason I'm creating this blog: to build myself as a brand.  Everyone should focus on building themselves as a brand.

There's lots of marketing authors, but only one Seth Godin.
There's lots of real estate Guru's, but only one Trump.
There's lots of pretty girls, but only one [Paris](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=18043).

Whatever it is that you do, probably plenty of other people do it as well.  So if you want to earn more for an hour of your time, your name has to be worth something.

Do you have a desire to be known in your field?
