1. Do you have a car? If so, what kind of car is it? We have two cars, a 2000 Lexus ES 300, and a 2001 Audi TT.

2. Do you drive very often? The TT serves as my daily commuter vehicle. The Lexus is my wife's primary car during the week. On the weekends we use the Lexus most of the time.

3. What's your dream car? A Lexus LS 430. In Black Cherry with a cream colored leather interior. Also a Acura NSX. In any color.

4. Have you ever received a ticket? Yes. In 25 years of driving I've had three speeding tickets. Court supervision for two, so only one is on my official record.

5. Have you ever been in an accident? Yes. My father was driving and I was the passenger. We were moving through an intersection when another car struck us from the driver's side. We did a complete 360 and ended up parallel parked, more or less. The car was totaled and we walked away unscratched.
