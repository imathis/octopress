Thanks to <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html" title="Google No Follow">Google</a>, MSN, and Yahoo, there's a new tool to fight comment and referer spam: the no follow tag.

MovableType already has a <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2005/01/movable_type_nofollow_p.shtml" title="MovableType Nofollow plugin">plugin</a> that works simply by dropping it in place.

To celebrate I have uncommented the comment link, and open comments for this posting. I realize that spam will continue for a time, but with the major search engines no longer cataloging it from inside comments (or on referer pages) most of the incentive will be gone.
