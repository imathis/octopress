Like all jobs (or most, anyway) mine came with a set of benefits, including two shiny floating holidays.  The parent company observes all the banking holidays each year, while my employer observes all but two.  To balance this inequity, we get two floating holidays each year.

I used one of mine way back last spring.  My vacation time was used in one chunk this year for our trip to see <a href="http://sibylleandmark.wordpress.com/category/hartfordgermany-trip/" title="Hartford / Germany Trip">Genesis and visit Gemany</a>.  Leaving me with just holidays and one floating holiday for time off.

We are down to the final weeks of the year, a holiday rich portion of the calendar.  Now it is time to carefully use my long hoarded floating holiday.  Should I extend the four-day weekend for Christmas to five days?  Or use it on the last possible day of the year, making the New Year holiday another four-day weekend?  Or take a random day off, just for fun?

Decisions, decisions.
