Some excellent writing on entrepreneurship came out in the blogosphere lately.

Check out [this brilliant article by billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban](http://blogmaverick.com/2008/10/23/the-cure-to-our-economic-problems/).  Here are some of my favorite quotes:

On why entrepreneurs are the cure for every economic crisis...


> Entrepreneurs who create something out of nothing don’t care what tax rates are...The impact of tax rates on productivity and development is something economists masterbate about,  enterpreneurs don’t waste their time thinking about it. We have business to do...



On why [business plans are bullshit](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-plans-are-bullshit/) and you shouldn't borrow money to start a business...


> The best businesses in recent entrepreneurial history are those that have been started with little or no money. Dell Computer, MicroSoft, Apple, HP and tens of thousands of others started in dorm rooms, tiny offices or garages. There weren’t 100 page long business plans...

Many entrepreneurs think the next step is to take all this feedback, update their 100 page business plans and go out and raise money. It’s as if the missing link for success in a business is cash to get started. It’s not. Far more often than not, raising cash is the biggest mistake you can make...

There are only two reasonable sources of capital for startup entrepreneurs, your own pocket and your customers pockets. I personally would never even take money from a family member.



Similarly, I enjoyed [this post by 7-time best selling marketing expert Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/10/be-careful-of-w.html) on why, if you do decide to get a job, you should be very careful about it.



> Your boss and your job determine not only what you do all day, but what you learn and who you interact with...Work in a high stress place and you're likely to become a highly stressed person, and your interactions will display that. Work for a narcissist and you'll develop into someone who's good at shining a light on someone else, not into someone who can lead. Work for someone who plays the fads and you'll discover that instead of building a steadily improving brand, you're jumping from one thing to another, enduring layoffs in-between gold rushes. Work for a bully and be prepared to be bullied...

There are plenty of books about getting a job, but no books I know of about choosing a job



Until next time, keep breaking free!
