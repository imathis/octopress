WiFi is truly a wonderful thing. Michele has a faculty meeting this afternoon, and lacking anything productive to do, I tagged along. So here I sit in the minimalist "cafe" at the community college surfing the 'net for free on their WiFi network. No fuss, no muss, just set the Airport to connect automatically and I've got an IP address and full network access.

It's hard to believe that I started my computer "lifetime" using acoustic couplers at 300 BAUD. If the past 30 years have taken us from punch cards and reel tape to flash memory and gigabit ethernet, what will the next 30 years bring us?
