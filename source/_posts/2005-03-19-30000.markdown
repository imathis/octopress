My statistics page tells me that <a href="zanshin.net" title="Zanshin.net">zanshin.net</a> has been viewed just over 30,000 times since late September. I'm averaging about 5,000 page views a month.

That's pretty cool.

What it doesn't account for is the number of "page views" that are the result of referrer spambots. Even using the "rel=nofollow" tag convention subscribed to by all the major search engines hasn't slowed the steady attempts to use my site for their slimy purposes.

Still 30,000 page views is 30,000 page views.
