The link below is to a video shot by a British photo journalist in Iraq.  It is not easy or pleasant to watch.  However I think it is necessary to watch.  Whatever your political stance, whatever your moral code, whatever your belief system, whatever your opinion on the Iraqi war, you need to watch this video.

At the end we are all of us humans.  Whether we are Iraqi, American, Saudi, solider, citizen, Christian, Muslim, or otherwise, we are all humans.  That there are humans on all sides of this horrifically complex issue dying is appalling.

I am reminded of a quote from a unlikely <a href="#" title="Calvin and Hobbes">source</a>, "I think the surest sign of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us."
