Neither of us had a lot of energy today, and we both ended up taking naps late this afternoon. After a dinner out at Panera we did some grocery shopping in anticipation of freezing drizzle followed by snow tonight and tomorrow morning. The plan is to not go out at all tomorrow.

I did manage to get our recycling to the local collection station this morning. After which I bought a terabyte hard drive to go along with the scanner we ordered. In addition to being handy network attached storage, this drive will hold one of at least two copies of every paper we scan. I suspect it will also be used as a backup drive for Sibylle's computer and the computer we use to track our money.

Other than instaling the drive on our network, and initiating the transfer of 50GB of videos from and older drive, I did little today. Which makes it a pretty good Saturday I think.
