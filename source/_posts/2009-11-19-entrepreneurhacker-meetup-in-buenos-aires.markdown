[Andrew Warner](http://mixergy.com/about/) and I put together a little entrepreneur meetup last night which turned out really well.

Well actually, I emailed Andrew when I saw on his blog that he was in Buenos Aires, and he had the great idea to post the meeting to [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=940180).  It ended up being a pretty good turnout.

Buenos Aires is turning into quite the little tech entrepreneur scene.  As I wrote on Hacker News...


> It does seem like something is brewing here. I think it got popular with Tim Ferriss' The Four Hour Work Week where he talks about Buenos Aires...lots of founders came down here. It's easier to bootstrap a web business because:

1. costs are much lower here

2. earning in dollars and spending in pesos means your money goes a long way (geo-arbitrage)

It's by no means huge yet, but there is a band of renegade expat coder/entrepreneurs I've met up with here that are doing some impressive stuff.
