Using the "Create a Map" feature over at <a title="Wayfaring.com" href="http://www.wayfaring.com">Wayfaring.com</a>, I made this map of our walking route through Chicago yesterday.  All told we covered about four and a half miles on foot.

(You can hover your mouse over the waypoints to see what they are.)
