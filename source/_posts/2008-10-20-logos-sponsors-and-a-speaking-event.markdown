A couple of announcements today:  First of all, please welcome our new sponsor [Methodology Marketing](http://www.methodologymarketing.com/) with their [custom logo design](http://www.methodologymarketing.com/) banner in the right sidebar of this page.

If you're thinking of getting a new logo designed for your business or project, make sure to check them out.  Their prices look very reasonable.

Secondly, if you would like to get your own site featured on Breaking Free, you too can snap up one of those [125x125 banners in the right sidebar now for JUST $15](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/advertise/).

It's a ridiculous price and much cheaper than any of the other ads I sell on this site.  I lowered the price because I'm converting those ads over from affiliate ads that weren't performing well and I want them to move, so I'm sure the price won't be $15 for much longer.

Finally, if you are in Houston, I'll be speaking at the After Hour Networking Group tomorrow Tuesday Oct. 21st at Maggie Rita's Restaurant, 2800 Sage (SW Corner Sage & Alabama, across from the Galleria).  Networking from 6-7pm, and the talk will be 7-8pm.

The topic will be **Successfully Starting and Running a Business on a Shoestring**.  Hope you can make it out!
