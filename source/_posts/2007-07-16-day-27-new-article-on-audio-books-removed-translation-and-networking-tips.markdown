[![Listening To Audio Books Is A Huge Boost In Productivity](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/752454_headphones_11-150x150.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/752454_headphones_11.jpg)This is day 27 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new readers to this blog, and demonstrate that blogging can be a [profitable and inexpensive business to start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

I skipped two days in the challenge because I decided to go a seminar on real estate investing for the weekend.  It was all day both days and I was just too tired to do anything else by the time I got home.  The seminar was awesome and I'll be posting some more about it in the future.  To be honest, I've been having trouble thinking about anything except what I learned over the past few days, and have already started taking action.

Another interesting note: I am now #12 on Google for the keyword "home based business".  Just last week I was #14 (and it fluctuated after that, going as high as #16).  First page (top ten) here I come!

Here are my three tasks for the day...





### 1. I wrote a new article for LifeHack.org



Since my contributing author positions tend to bring in the most readers to this site, I've written another article for LifeHack.org on the [importance of listening to audio books](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/business-education-how-to-devour-at-least-one-business-book-per-week-without-taking-any-additional-time-out-of-your-day/).



### 2. Removed Translation



Based on the [website translation feedback](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-25-translated-into-8-languages-a-version-for-mobile-devices-and-submitted-to-dozens-of-blog-directories/) I got, I decided to remove the Google translation links from this website.  Apparently the translations were just too poor to be useful, and it was taking up prime real estate (see!) in the sidebar.



### 3. Handed out more business cards


Finally, I met about six people over the past two days who were somehow involved or interested in entrepreneurship and gave them a card.  Not only that, but I got their card as well.  This is extremely important because I've noticed that people love to exchange cards, but only a small percentage ever follow up.

In other words, it's up to YOU to follow up with them.  The number of people who will take you card and actually visit the website or contact you is pitifully small.  When I contact them I usually try think of something that would be useful to them, and I don't write anything about my website.  I include it in the footer, and usually just because I had mentioned it to them previously, they will visit the website.

This is key, because you aren't pushing it on them and writing to say "by the way check out my website!"  People's immediate reaction is to run away when you do that, because they think you must be selling something.

Step 1: get their card, don't just give yours
Step 2: follow up as soon as you get home, don't delay
Step 3: offer value to them by talking about what they want, not what you want.
