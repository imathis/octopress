There are a lot of people doing work in information products lately and making money with them. I've experimented with it quite a bit in the past and haven't found it to be a great fit for me personally.




Part of the problem is that it is mostly done by people in the "internet marketing" community whom I don't much like. I feel like you can learn something valuable from all people and it's worth understanding the fundamentals of good marketing, but 90% of the stuff out there from that community is junk. It's "non-experts" pretending to be experts and comes from a mentality of "I want to make a quick buck" and not "how can I create something really useful". Ironically, the later tends to earn you much more money in the long run.




Eben Pagan, however, is one of the folks in the 10% whose stuff I regularly read/listen to. He manages to keep it classy, his advice is often applicable to business in general (not just info products), and he's the real deal having built a $20 million dollar annual business.




[This video of his](http://www.gurumastermindtraining.com/CD559/video/) is definitely worth checking out (you've gotta opt in to get the second part but it's worth it).
