<em>Like one, that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows, a frightful fiend,
Doth close behind him tread.</em>

Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner,
Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834)

<em>I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark, or even eagle flew -
And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand and touched the face of God.</em>

~ John G. Magee, Jr.'s poem "High Flight"
