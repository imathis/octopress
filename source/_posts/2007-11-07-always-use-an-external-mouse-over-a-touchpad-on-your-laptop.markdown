It bothers me when I see people using the touch pad on their laptop while at a desk for long periods of time.  I've never seen an official study done on it, but I'd guess that you are 25 to 30% faster using a regular external mouse instead of a touch pad.  The touch pad is only there for when you are on the move and don't have access to anything else!
