In the past I've written that one of the best ways to test out a business idea is to throw up a quick website for it.  This is inexpensive and will help you get feedback for your idea and possibly your first few customers.

In the past [it took me about 4 hours using Wordpress](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/a-new-business-website-from-start-to-finish-in-4-hours/) and I thought that proved how easy it was.  Well now you can do it in about 30 MINUTES!

I came across an really cool service yesterday called [Weebly](http://www.weebly.com). It does the Wordpress technical mumbo jumbo for you (uploading files with FTP, etc) and gives you a totally graphical way to install and build the site!

It is super easy and well designed.  In about 10 minutes I was able to create this test site with a professional layout, contact forum, blog, complete forum, and blocks for Google Adsense.

They will host the site for you for about $4/month and you can pick your own domain name.  Now you have NO EXCUSE not to get your business idea going!

One final bonus trick: pick a domain name that [contains the primary keyword](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-use-domain-names-to-improve-your-google-rankings/) you'd like to rank for in Google.  This will help you get on the first page of Google for that search term - which means customers!  Boom, you have your own business.
