This evening, in my inbox, there was an email notification of some new postings on the Illinois state procurement web site. I pointed my browser at the site and started down through the list of posting. Second from the end was DHS, my client agency.

Downloading the PDF file of awards, I was thrilled, excited, immensely pleased, and relieved to see the name of the company I subcontract through listed. And further relieved to see the same rate as I have been billing.

How do I spell relief?
C-o-n-t-r-a-c-t
