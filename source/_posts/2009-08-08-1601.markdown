As I sat down this evening to start a posting about the CARS program, I discovered that the last posting I made was the 1600th on zanshin.net. I no longer have a word count on the site, so I've lost track of the words I've written here, but I believe it was well north of 300,000 a couple of years ago.

If you had told me ten years ago that the little web site I played around with would become a place for me to write about my greatest triumphs, and deepest sorrows, I would not have believed you. It has been an amazing ten years since I started blogging here; I can hardly wait to see what the next ten years, and beyond, holds.
