If your goal is to make a passive business, sometimes you have to find creative ways to _automate_ tasks which would otherwise be performed by a human being.

Case in point: someone recently started spamming my [tutoring site](http://www.universitytutor.com/) with messages like these:

This type of scam shows up often on CraigsList.com and it just recently hit my site for the first time.

By the way, if you haven't seen it before it goes like this: the person makes an offer to pre-pay a large amount up front.  They send you a phony money order.  After you've received the fake money order they say they are going to have to cancel and ask for a partial refund.  You send them a refund (with real money), and a week later the bank comes back to inform you that the money order you tried to deposit was fake.

You can spot these because usually (1) the person is out of country (2) the grammar is poor (3) they will refuse to talk to you on the phone (3) they want to make a large payment up front.

**Manual Process vs. Automated Process**

It's annoying for the tutors to receive these messages, and it might be tempting at this point to create a "manual review" process where a human being would look at each tutor request before it gets sent.

This however, wouldn't be very passive.

Instead, you can often use your "community" of users to be a police force for you.  Wikipedia (and a number of other sites) have employed this model very successfully with a self policing community.

The solution I came up with was to add this line to the end of all emails:

Then I built a little system so that if enough people report the spammer, the account will get deleted and they won't be able to bother anyone else.

Some interesting things to think about when building a system like this:



	
  1. If you notify the spammer that their account has been banned/blocked.  They will probably start using new email addresses or be more motivated to get around your system.  Instead, I set it up so the spammer gets NO INDICATION that their messages are being blocked.  That means they will happily go about trying to send new messages and working hard...UTTERLY WASTING THEIR TIME as punishment.  Maybe this subtle form of punishment will eventually cause them to reconsider their line of work since it will accomplish nothing.

	
  2. You don't want to ban the person if just one person flags them as a spammer.  The tutor could use this maliciously if they want to avoid getting negative reviews or block the user for any other reason.  Therefore you must try to get a "consensus" from the community by getting a few different opinions.  The exact right number is debatable, but the more people mark them as a spammer the more confident you can be about banning them.



Most business owners don't think about the cost of answering one extra phone or email.  "It will just take a second" they say.  It makes them feel busy (which is very different than being productive) to solve easy problems.  Instead, they should be working "on" their business, not "in" it.

If you want to make a truly passive business, you need to put systems in place to handle 99% of whatever might happen automatically.  Even if your automated solution works only 90% as well as the human solution, it will still be worth it.  Every phone call or email DOES count, because you want to scale your business up to 100 or 1,000 times it's current level without hiring any employees.  Hiring employees isn't the answer (managing/hiring/firing them is just another job and isn't passive).  Instead, focus on building business systems to automate as many tasks as possible.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
