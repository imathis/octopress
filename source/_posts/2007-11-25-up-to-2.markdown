Recently I've been up to:
<ul>
<li class="il">Making the inaugural pot of chili for the 2007-2008 season.</li>
<li class="il">Learning the ins and outs of Wordpress templates and themes.</li>
<li class="il">Playing around with Ubuntu.</li>
<li class="il">Drawing house plans on graph paper.</li>
<li class="il">Demolishing the leftover bread stuffing.</li>
</ul>
