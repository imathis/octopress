<a href="http://alternet.org/" target="_blank">AlterNet</a> is carrying a copy of Senator Robery Byrd's, June 24, 2003 <a href="http://alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=16261" target="_blank">speech</a> regarding the cover up by President Bush and his administration over the actual threat Iraq posed to the United States in the months leading up to our invasion, and subsequent occupation, of that country.

I wish I lived in West Virginia so I could vote for this courageous man for taking a stand against the whitewash the conservatives are spreading over their actions.

Please go read the <a href="http://alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=16261" target="_blank">speech</a> and then <a href="http://vote-smart.org" target="_blank">write</a> your congressman or senator and ask them why they aren't standing up and asking the same questions as Senator Byrd.
