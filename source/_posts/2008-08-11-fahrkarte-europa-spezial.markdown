On our trip to Europe this year, Sibylle and I will be doing some travel by train.  Our flight to Europe lands in Zürich, and we are taking the train to Stuttgart from there.  Wanting to take advantage of some special rates for trains starting or ending in Germany we went ahead and booked our seats.  Today's mail brought an overseas envelope containing our seat reservations and tickets.

We still need to reserve and by our tickets between Stuttgart and Bressanone Italy, where we are spending a week of our trip.  Once those tickets have been secured we'll be largely set, transportation wise.
