Between online shopping on the Internet and package delivery services like FedEX, the world just keeps getting smaller.

I ordered an <a href="http://www.zanshin.net/blogs/000732.html" title="$50 More">iPod for myself</a> Tuesday afternoon at 3:01 pm. The order history on FedEx starts at 10:33 am on Wednesday morning in Shanghai China. Turns out that 3:10 PM CST on 1/10/2006 is 5:01 AM China time on 1/11/2006. The order was shipped from China by 12:20 PM 1/11/2006 (or 10:20 PM here on the 10th). Since then it has been to Alaska and Indiana, and it is currently at the local FedEx facility in Lenexa - just down the road from my apartment. 39 hours and 53 minutes from the time the order was placed until it is on the truck, out for delivery - <i>from half way around the planet.</i>

And I ordered custom engraving for my iPod so at least the back had to complete manufacturing before it should be shipped. Unbelievable.
