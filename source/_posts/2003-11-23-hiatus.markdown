There will be a short hiatus on zanshin.net while we celebrate Thanksgiving this week. We are traveling to be with Michele's mom this week. We are excited about traveling for Thanksgiving, it seems so, American.

We are going "internet-less" for the duration so no updates until we return.

We hope that you are safe and happy over the holiday. Enjoy the people you are with and be thankful.
