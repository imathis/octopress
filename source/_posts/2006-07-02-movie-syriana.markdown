I watched <i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0365737/" title="Syriana">Syriana</a></i> yesterday, and I'm still trying to figure out just what the hell it was about. I got the part about oil being exploited by corrupt and greedy men. I got the part about how the American people don't want justice but rather the illusion of justice. And I guess Matt Damon's character had to fall from grace and nearly be blown up before he saw the error of his ways.

But I still don't know what the movie was about.

Rating: Compelling if not entirely understandable
