<a href="http://zanshin.net" title="Zanshin.net">Zanshin.net</a> is moving to a new host this weekend.  The DNS change has been initiated and should complete in the a day or so.  (For the <em>uninitiated</em>, <strong>D</strong>omain <strong>N</strong>ame <strong>S</strong>ervers provide the translation between the URL you type (zanshin.net) and the actual IP address of the site.  Moving to a new host requires that the whole hierarchy of DNS be updated with the new information.  This can take 24-48 hours.)

Since I am also changing registrars, there is a lock-out period where changes can't happen.  Domain theft has caused the registrars to insert numerous layers of protection to insure that your site is not stolen from you.  That lock-out period is what will complete early next year.

Hopefully all you, dear reader, will see, is a change in the site's presentation from the old visual format, to a new (temporary) format.  Should there be a brief outage, please come back later, and hopefully I'll have all the tubes plugged in and working properly again.
