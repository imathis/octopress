My posting about CFL bulbs and their hazards seems to have been well timed.  On Slashdot today, there is a link to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23694819/" title="Shining a light on fluorescent bulbs">this MSNBC story about the growing concern</a> in the environmental community about the safety of the bulbs in light of their mercury content.

And, from the Cool Tools site, there is this <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/002704.php" title="Lemnis Pharox LED Bulb">article about LED light bulbs</a> that one day may light our homes.

Finally, the construction crew forman was good to his word and cleaned up the broken bulb in our basement.  Moreover he did it without complaint or protest, which went a long ways toward restoring our good feeling about the work being done to our home.
