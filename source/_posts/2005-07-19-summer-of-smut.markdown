Michele and I both like "reality" television. Our favorite shows are Survivor and Amazing Race. We also liked The Mole when it was on the air. However our shameful secret is that we also watch Big Brother.

Each season has gotten more and more smutty. It's like a whole summer of the Jerry Springer show. On steroids. The people willing to expose themselves (literally and figuratively) on this show are an amazing cross section of self-important, full-of-themselves exhibitionists.

We find ourselves repulsed and attracted at the same time. Rather like passing an automobile accident and having to slow down to look.
