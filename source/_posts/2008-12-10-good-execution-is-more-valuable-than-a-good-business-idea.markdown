A lot of entrepreneurs are freaked out about telling people their business ideas.  They act like it's a big secret that someone will steal!

Usually there is no need for this.  Great business ideas are abundant, it's the execution of them that is really difficult.

For example, we all know that if someone could create a super fuel efficient car, or a machine that washed and dried your clothes in one step, or an operating system that never crashed - they'd be rich!  Those aren't secrets, they just happen to come with difficult execution.

You aren't the only one with your business idea.  Lot's of people have had it.  It's just that 90% of them will never act on it, and of those that do, 90% of them won't get it right.  Maybe (hopefully) you will!
