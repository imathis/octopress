My father loves mysteries and introduced me to Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallender series. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400031575/sr=8-1/qid=1147575996/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-8431449-0190249?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="Faceless Killers">Faceless Killers</a> is only the first. Set in Sweden, the characters are richly developed, and bleak, wet cold of a northern latitude winter makes you ache as you imagine being there.

Rating: I've already gone out and purchased the second book in the series.
