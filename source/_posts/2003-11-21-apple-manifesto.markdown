Being relatively new to the world of Apple computers, I hadn't ever seen or heard about the "Here's to the Crazy Ones" manifesto. Now that I've seen it I wanted to put it here on my site as a reminder to always look outside the box.

To The Crazy Ones
Here's to the crazy ones
The misfits.
The nerds.
The troublemakers.
The round pegs in the square holes.
The ones who see things differently.

They are not fond of rules,
And they have no respect for the status quo.

You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them,
disbelieve them, glory or vilify them.
About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.

Because they change things.
They invent.   They imagine.   They heal.
They explore. They create.     They inspire.
They push the human race forward.

Maybe they have to be crazy.
How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?
Or sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written?
Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?

We make tools for these kinds of people.
While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.

Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can
change the world, are the ones who do.

Think differently.
