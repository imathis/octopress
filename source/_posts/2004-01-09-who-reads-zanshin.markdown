I just read an interesting <a href="http://www.makikoitoh.com/archives/2004/01/09/do_you_tell_your_family.php" title="makiko itoh">posting</a> which asked the question, "Do you tell your family about your blog?"

The comment I posted on Makiko's site went like this:
<p class="quote"> I write about a variety of topics on my site, sometimes intensely personal and other times trivial fluff.</p>
I've never openly invited immediate family members to go and read my site; like you they all get e-mail from me with the domain name, so they "know" where it is located.

I guess I would be okay with them reading it since I would not expect feedback or to get my needs met through them. For all I know they are reading it now and just not saying anything to me.

Beyond immediate family and friends, I am curious to know who reads my site. I can see by referer logs, and site counters how many of you there are, and where some of you came from. But I really have no interaction with the people reading my thoughts. It makes this form of communication unique.

Click the comments link below and let me know who you are, and whether or not you have a weblog.
