I am in the process of adding some of the postings that lived on my site prior to my switch to moveabletype. I have been meaning to do this for some time and kept putting it off.

All of these entries were written between December 1999 and September 2001. I was hand coding all my pages back then and additional effort prevented me from posting as often as I do now.

I'm re-adding them to the site using their original posting date, so they'll all be listed towards the bottom of the History page.

Enjoy.
