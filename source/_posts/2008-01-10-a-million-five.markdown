Being a nerd, I have a salary history spreadsheet that contains every pay increase, every promotional raise, and every new job I've had in over the past twenty-five years.  As much as possible these events are tied to the actual dates, therefore I can calculate how much I made at each salary.  

The limitations of the Excel <strong>DAY()</strong> function come into play here, as it treats each year as twelve 30-day units, for a total of 360 days. Five missing days twenty five times is only 125 days out of 9125, or 1.36%.  and acceptable margin of error.

Today I had the pleasure of entering this year's salary increase, and in seeing a new lifetime earnings total.

$1,508,318.30.

Crikey.
