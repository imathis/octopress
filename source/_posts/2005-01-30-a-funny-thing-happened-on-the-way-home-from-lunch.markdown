Last weekend we picked up a Kansas City Star to see the real estate ads, mostly to see what kinds of house were for rent or sale in town. There was a story on the front page of the real estate section about an open house at a development of maintenance-free, ranch style condos. So we planned to go a see the place this weekend.

Today, after a new mouse <a href="http://www.zanshin.net/blogs/000550.html" title="Bluetooth Mouse Hunt">purchase</a> and lunch out at Sweet Tomatoes, we ventured to the far east side of the KC metropolitan area, to Lee's Summit, to see the homes at Courchevel. During our initial drive around we saw one that was for sale by owner and, after calling the posted number, we got a tour from the owner.

The house was very nice, 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, a den/office, sun room, and 2 car garage. High vaulted ceilings, tile flooring in the entry and sun room, and a laundry room off the back entry. While the home was attached to its neighbors, one attachment was via the garage, and the other common wall was either kitchen, pantry, or laundry area. The kitchen was airy and well laid out. In a word we were impressed.

We then visited the office and asked to see the various models. While they had a floor plan that was larger, and one that was smaller, the one we liked was one we had seen for sale privately. The only differences buying from the developer would be (a) no prior owners, and (b) some control over carpet color and cabinet finish. The one available from the developer backs up to a green area and steep slope owned by the developer. It is not to be developed so we'll never have a neighbor behind us.

Before we left we filled out a contract and made arrangements to leave an ernest money deposit tomorrow. They have a "family member" clause that allows us seven days to back out with no obligation. So tomorrow when people ask what we did over the weekend I can say, "we bought a house."

Oh. My. God.
