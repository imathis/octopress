The stress and toil of the past few months has finally caught up with me. I've been  constantly tired for weeks now and last evening I just couldn't bring myself to do anything. I was planning on attending the Wednesday evening kendo-in-the-park practice, but with an outside temperature in the low 90s I decided to pass and stayed home (and cool) instead.

By 7:15 I was getting sleepy and so I went and laid on the bed and read for a while. By 8:30 I had turned my light out and was sound asleep. It was still light outside. I must have needed a good night's sleep as I didn't wake at all until 5:00 this morning - almost nine hours of sleep. I feel much better this morning and I am planning on turning in early again this evening.

Like Ben Franklin said, "early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise."
