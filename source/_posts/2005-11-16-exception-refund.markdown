Michele and I had bought plane tickets to travel to NC for Thanksgiving way back in early September. We did this through Expedia.com and I called them to see about getting a refund once I made the decision not to go by myself. I sent all the paperwork they asked for THREE weeks ago and today I called to see what the status of the exception refund was. They claim they've never received my letter.

Now I know that when I've used that excuse in the past I was lying, so I am assuming they are lying as well. When was the last time the USPS lost a letter? They just don't want to refund the $526 to me. So now I get to resubmit my claim, this time using a "traceable shipping method." I.E., Fed Ex.

Bastards.

The worst part is they are only going to turn around and submit it to the airline for me. They say it could be 2 - 3 months before I get the refund and that my claim could be denied altogether. Happy happy, joy joy.

Sigh.
