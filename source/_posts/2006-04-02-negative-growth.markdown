Next weekend, on my way to Chicago to see J &amp; J publicly proclaim their commitment to each other, I am stopping off in Decatur. Like my last visit a few weeks ago I am simultaneously looking forward to, and dreading the time spent there. Mom's initial diagnosis in February indicated a two month life-span, untreated. While she has been able to undergo some treatments, a scan last week revealed that the tumor has grown at least twenty percent. As she puts it, her condition is terminal. My father tells me that she is comfortable for the most part, and not in much pain. With no real roadmap there is no way to know when she will die.

And so I don't know if this will be the last time I see her or not.

Being a grownup sucks, sometimes.
