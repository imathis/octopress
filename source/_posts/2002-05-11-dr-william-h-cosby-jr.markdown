We saw Bill Cosby tonight. Live. In person. It was most excellent. I had seen him 22 years ago while in college and tonight's performance was every bit as good as the first one. We laughed until our sides hurt and then we laughed some more.

Afterwards we had Thai food and chocolate ice cream, and a great discussion about my family. We both feel estranged from my brother and this was the topic. He matches the criteria for a borderline personality disorder, which is rare in males, and knowing that helps to understand some of his actions. The most recent hard-to-understand action was the total lack of acknowledgment of my  41st birthday. No card, note, e-mail, phone call, or gift. Nothing.

It is painful but I am learning to deal with it.
