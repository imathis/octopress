Last night, actually this morning at 1:21 am I won a bid for a supposedly new Apple Powerbook G4 Titanium laptop. The upscale 800MHz model, with 1 GB of RAM and a 60 GB hard drive. The seller accepted Amazon payments so I've plunked my cash down and now I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of a box.

Then I'll know if I got the deal of a lifetime or taken for a ride.
