I've fiddled around with the header image, finally getting the original image in its entirety once again.  The cropped image was nice enough, but I prefer the one I've had for most of the past decade.  The image is a slice of an old Corel wallpaper called <em>Autumn Coast</em>, which I've misplaced.  If any of you still has a circa 1997 Corel images CD, let me know in the comments.

There is also the beginnings of a true <em>colophon </em>page, which is details about how the site is published, the fonts used, and other nerdy tidbits.
