[![MyBlogLog](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/mybloglog1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/mybloglog1.png)This is day 7 of my 30 day [marketing challenge](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/16/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).  Today's ideas come mostly from John Reese's article [here](http://www.income.com/blog/2007/06/12/calling-all-seo-super-geeks/).

1. I adjusted my link structure to be a simpler format: "/postTitle/" instead of what it was "/year/month/day/postTitle/".  Supposedly this will help search engines pull keywords out of the links by making them shorter and the directory structure smaller.  I used [this plugin](http://www.deanlee.cn/wordpress/permalinks-migration-plugin/) to make sure I don't break any links in the transition.

2. I added a big list of "update services".  Updated services are websites that get notified (pinged) each time you make a post on the blog.  Here are the ones I added:

http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping
http://api.moreover.com/ping

3. I submitted the site to [MyBlogLog](http://www.mybloglog.com/) and tagged it with the right keywords.  This (in theory) allows a community to develop around your blog where people will say they like your blog and will share it with others.  I don't know much about it but it was recommended.  It comes with a little snippet of code you can use on your website that shows who has viewed the site recently.  I couldn't format it correctly on my site so I removed it.  Hopefully it can still be used without the snippet of code installed (this is what I assume, but can't say for sure).

I wanted to also try changing the hyphens in my link structure to underscores too, but was unable to find a way to do this.
