1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?
I would have to say novels.

2. What is your favorite novel?
I can only have one? Hmm. How about 'Cryptonomicon' by Neal Stephenson.

3. Do you have a favorite poem?  (Share it!)
Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove
That valleys, groves, hills, and fields,
Woods, or steepy mountain yields.

And we will sit upon rocks,
Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks,
By shallow rivers to whose falls
Melodious birds sing madrigals.

And I will make thee beds of roses
And a thousand fragrant poises,
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle;

A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty lambs we pull;
Fair lined slippers for the cold,
With buckles of the purest gold;

A belt of straw and ivy buds,
With coral clasps and amber studs;
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me, and be my love.

The shepherd's swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each May morning:
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me and be my love.

~Christopher Marlowe 1599


4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?
I have always wanted to read the plays of William Shakespeare.

5. What are you currently reading?
"The Vanished Man" by Jeffrey Deaver, "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking, "Programming Jakarta Struts" by Chuck Cavaness, and "Mac OS X in a Nutshell" from O'Reilly Press.
