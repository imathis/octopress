Since I [spent a year](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/oh-snap-im-moving-to-south-america/) in Buenos Aires, Argentina people sometimes ask me what my experience was and if I'd recommend it.

For example, here is a recent reader question and my response:


> Hey Brian,

Did you like being in Argentina? Is it as good as its cracked up to be and as cost-effective? How much does it cost (US dollars) to live really well down there?
R.D.


**My response:**

_Hi R.D.,_

_ _

_I don't want to oversell it as I think some people have online.  Outside the city there is some serious poverty.  But inside there are some nice areas and certainly a different cool sort of European culture you can find with very nice people and good food.  I'd say you can live comfortably there on anywhere from $1000-$2000 a month, but of course this varies a lot based on your taste.  Things are not drastically cheaper there (some more, some less) but I'd say on average prices are about 25-50% cheaper than the U.S.  (of course you may not be earning as many U.S. dollars while you are down there)._

_Overall I'm very glad I did it, and I think it's one of those life experiences that has helped me grow as a person.  But don't buy into the tales of travel as some mystical experience.  It is a city just like anywhere else, with good people and bad people.  Take it for what it's worth and enjoy it as a fun experience either with a partner or as a process of self discovery on your own._

_Compared to other places I've traveled in the world, BA is definitely up there in the top 3._

_Thank you,

====================================

**Further Thoughts**

One surprising result after traveling abroad is that I definitely developed a much bigger appreciation of the U.S.

People tend to romanticize foreign countries by saying the people there appreciate the important things in life, or are happier with what they have, or generally lead simpler lives that aren't based on rushing around, checking your email 20 times a day, and being so career oriented.

It can be nice to experience this as a temporary reprieve from a busy life, but for locals who actually live abroad this romanticized idea quickly evaporates.  Greater corruption exists (I witnessed both bribing of police and city inspectors while in Buenos Aires), taxes are higher (creating a large grey market), and there is plenty of counterfeit money and petty theft.  For people with fewer opportunities in life, crime is an attractive option.

The U.S. has many flaws, but strictly in terms of economic opportunity I haven't seen a better place to live yet.  For me at least this is a trump card, although clearly everyone has difference priorities.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
