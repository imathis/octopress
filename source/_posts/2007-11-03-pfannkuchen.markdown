This morning for <em>frühstück</em> we had <em>Pfannkuchen</em>, or German style pancakes.  The recipe was a little thinner than Sibylle remember from her childhood, but the flavor was right, and we both enjoyed them.

6 eggs
1 Cup flour
1 Cup milk
1/2 Cup sugar (although next time we'll try 1/4 Cup sugar)
butter

(I actually only used 5 eggs, as that was all we had.  I might be tempted to try 4 eggs to get the batter a bit thicker the next time.  Your mileage may vary.)

Mix the flour and sugar together, and then add the milk and mix.  Beat the eggs in a separate bowl before adding them to the dry mix.  Mix thoroughly with a whisk.

Cook over medium heat in a skillet with a little butter.  The batter is much thinner than American style batter and so it will spread out to cover the pan.  When the edges start to dry, flip to the other side.  The second side won't take nearly as long as the first to cook.

The result is more crepe than cake, but delicious.  Sprinkle a bit of sugar on the Pfannkuchen and roll up to eat.  Or cover with your favorite fruit jelly, or syrup, or honey.

<em>Guten morgen</em>.
