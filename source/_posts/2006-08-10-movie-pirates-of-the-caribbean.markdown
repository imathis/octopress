I never saw <i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0325980/" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl">Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl</a></i> when it originally came out. A friend loaned me the DVD last week and I watched it over the weekend. People kept telling me that I'd like it, and it was good, but a bit childish. I guess I'll have to see part two now.

Rating: Good clean fun even if it does romanticize pirates
