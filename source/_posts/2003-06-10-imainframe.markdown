<a href="http://www.zanshin.net/blogs/000204.html#000204" target="_blank">Once</a> upon a time, a long time ago, when I was in high school I was fortunate enough to learn basic programming via a TTY teletype terminal, optical scan cards, and time sharing with a local manufacturing companies mainframe.

The Greene County (North Carolina) Board of Education unanimously endorsed a plan Monday night that would provide iBooks to every student and teacher in the middle and high schools, according to a <a href=http://www.kinston.com/Details.cfm?StoryID=11706" target="_blank">Kinston.com</a> article. Under the project, the school system will buy 1,783 computers for grades 6-12.

Can you imagine going to school and being handed a brand new iBook to use for the school year? Being able to run a program or two a week via time sharing was enough to spark an interest in technology that is still burning strong in me. To have a whole computer of my own at age 12 just boggles my mind.
