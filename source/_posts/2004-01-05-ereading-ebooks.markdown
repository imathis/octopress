For the past several years I have been enjoying reading books electronically. With the gift of a palm m515 handheld computer from my wife a couple of years ago I discovered that it was, among other things, an excellent platform for reading books.

Combined with the free book reader from <a href="http://www.peanutpress.com" title="Peanut Press">Peanut Press</a> and the diverse collection of titles offered there as well, I have amassed a large collection of books. At last count 476 titles from 87 authors; all in less than 188 MB of disk space.

Over time I have noticed that more and more books are presented in this format, and more publishers are making good use of the "e" part of the format. In-line images, chapter and footnote links, and cover art are now common place. While I am aware that reading books via the limited screen of a handheld computer is not for everyone, I for one am sold.

If you have a palm, or other handheld computer, and you enjoy reading, I strongly urge you to explore the growing world of electronic books online.
