> Hi Brian,
Any suggestions on how I would go about getting a mentor with a similar specialization that would be willing to help future competition?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Michele,

Just think about who is doing what you want to do already SUCCESSFULLY.  Then try to get their email or just show up if you have to and ask for 5 minutes of their time.  Tell them you'd like to get started and would appreciate any advice they could give.  Ask them how they got started when they were in your place.  Play to their vanity and desire to teach others.

If they are already successful they won't care about creating competition because they'll know competition is good for them and helping others is even more to their advantage.  If they do care about this then they are small time and you don't want their advice anyway, trust me (you should run out the door).

They'll probably give you some task (book to read, or put some plan together, etc).  Do it (this will prove to them you're serious) and now you can check in with them later to show it to them.  Ask for the next step and do it.  Repeat, and you have a mentor.

Brian
