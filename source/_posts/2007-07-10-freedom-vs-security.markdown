I've always struggled to explain working for yourself to other people.  Some just instantly 'get it' and some don't really see the point.

I think Jeremy Shoemaker hit the nail on the head with his post on [Freedom vs. Security](http://www.shoemoney.com/2007/07/04/freedom-or-security/).

That's all it is, which do you value more?  Clearly I'm a freedom person, but I see now that entrepreneurship just wouldn't make sense to someone who values security above all else.

To me this was the best part though:


> I was talking to a friend who owns several local businesses the other day about this very thing. We both kind of agreed its a awesome thing that there are so many security people out there who are satisfied to work 9-5 and make their owners (or stockholders) rich.



If you aren't willing to take the risks, then it's tough to get the rewards.

I love it when a simple theory can be used to sum up a complex idea.  Which do you value more freedom or security?
