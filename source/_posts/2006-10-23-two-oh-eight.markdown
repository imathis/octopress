I have finally crossed the forty pound barrier and entered into the single digits above two hundred pounds. When I originally altered my eating habits I was hoping that in a year's time I would lose fifty pounds and once again be under two hundred. That I am just eight pounds away from that goal after only five months is astonishing to me.

My new goal is somewhere between one-sixty-five and one-seventy-five. The body-mass-index people think I should weigh one-sixty-eight, but to be honest I'll be thrilled with anything under one-eighty. That's only twenty-eight pounds away.
