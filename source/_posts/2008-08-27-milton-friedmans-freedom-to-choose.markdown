In the last 6 months or so I've become a big [Milton Friedman](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/how-to-understand-economics-better-than-an-mba-in-just-28-minutes/) fan.  Complex issues like inflation, money supply, economic growth, unemployment, government spending, deficits, etc always seemed like complex issues to me with many sides to the story.  You could read or ask 20 different people about issues like that and you'd get 20 different answers.

Somehow, Milton Friedman seems to make them easy to understand, and I feel almost embarrassed that I didn't understand them better before.

He has now passed away, but I just finished watching part of his 1980 documentary called "Freedom To Choose" and it's outstanding.  You can [watch one part of it here](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5538021588734490153&ei=1Oi0SP_OOqG0qAPj1sijBQ&q=milton+friedman+free+to+choose), although I recommend you check out the whole thing.



I was shocked when reading Fortune Magazine recently (where Obama and McCain discuss the economy) to see a quote from McCain stating that his economic role model was Milton Friedman.  That certainly caught my eye.  Although I'm more liberal socially on some issues than McCain, this was a huge plus for me.  I don't think Obama's plan for the economy makes any sense at all (he wants to raise business taxes, taxes on wealthy, and increase government spending... basically the exact opposite of what would help the economy).

It's interesting to note that Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, has decided to [fund a study from the top 500 economists](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/fixing_the_world/) (at great personal expense) to see where they fall on the presidential election coming up.  I feel pretty confident they will come down economically on the side of McCain (it's just such a shame he hasn't come around on some other issues, I'm not totally sold on him :).

Apparently, even [Arnold Schwarzenegger is a Milton Friedman fanboy](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2765840490646652904&ei=1Oi0SP_OOqG0qAPj1sijBQ&q=milton+friedman+free+to+choose&vt=lf)!   (Which actually really helps explain his politics.)
