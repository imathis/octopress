Yaro Starak has got a couple more great pieces of content up.

First, of all you can check out [this interview he did with Alborz Fallah](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/caradvice).

Alborz started [a blog](http://www.caradvice.com.au/) about cars that is targetted to the Australian market.  It now makes over a half million per year in revenue and is valued at $5 Million.  And he started the blog while working at his full time job!

He also put up two more videos that show exactly how he (Yaro) makes money on his blog.  There is a breakdown from a whole bunch of different sources, many of which I use on this blog as well.

He also includes a behind the scenes look at his tracking software where you can see the proof (checks, orders coming in, etc) or how he actually makes over $10k per month on his blog.

This is great educational material, and very inspiring.  Thanks Yaro.
