Yesterday my LASIK procedure went smoothly and without any complications. The doctor said the surgery went perfectly. There are plenty of things to write about, however, I'm still in the first 24-hour period where the flap hasn't started to really heal yet. So everything it a bit fuzzy around the edges.

With my left eye covered I am able to read up close things that I couldn't read before - even with my glasses. And some distances are now coming into focus for my left eye. Together, however, they are still producing an off-focus view of the world. Driving in to work there were lots of halos around street and traffic lights.

All-in-all I am pleased with the whole experience. More tomorrow, when I can see better still.
