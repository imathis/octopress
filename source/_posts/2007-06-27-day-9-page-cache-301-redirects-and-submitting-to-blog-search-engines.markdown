This is Day 9 of my 30 day [marketing challenge](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/) to make a profitable blog website.

1. I installed the [WordPress Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cache/) plugin so that the pages on this site will load faster.  I noticed it becoming a bit sluggish, and this seemed to have helped a lot.



2. I installed a bunch more 301 redirects to fix more [broken links](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-8-feedflares-reciprocal-links-broken-links/).

3. I started working off of [this](http://www.aripaparo.com/archive/000632.html) list of blog search engines.  I submitted Breaking Free to almost all of them (some were dead links).  This will help generate more links to the site (to improve rankings in Google, the main benefit) and drive some traffic directly (secondary benefit).
