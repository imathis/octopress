After some poking around on Google, I found a <a title="Wordpress" href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> plugin that closes the comments on posts older than 14 days, automatically. Â Since most of the comment spam I get is on older postings, I am hoping that <a title="Close Old Posts plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/close-old-posts/">Close Old Posts</a> will reduce the amount of spam Askimet has to filter for me.
