Some quick updates....

My mother (yes, she reads this blog) let me know today that I achieved a #1 page rank for the very competitive keyword "[home based business](http://www.google.com/search?q=home+based+business&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a)" (currently at #8)!

This has been a few months work that finally paid off, especially as part of my [30 day marketing challenge](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

Secondly, a few days ago I redesigned the [sales page for my book](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/breaking-free/) based on an [extensive critique I had done](http://www.copyblogger.com/landing-page-makeover-2/) (you can see the before pictures there).  I'll report back on the change in conversion rate in about a week or two once there is enough data to make a reasonable conclusion.
