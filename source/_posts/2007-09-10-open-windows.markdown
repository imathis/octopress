For the first time since early this summer, perhaps even as early as May, we were able to sleep with the windows open last night.  This was also the first time in years that I have slept with the windows open in my home in a cross-breeze.  The apartment I lived in for the last three years had all of its openings on one side of the building, consequently getting any kind of breeze at all was rare.  To be able to lie in bed and feel a gentle current of cool air moving through the room on its way from one set of windows to the next was delicious.

The break from the summer heat was good too.  After several weeks of high 90 and low 100 temperatures getting up this morning to an outside temperature of 64 degrees was very nice.  For its cooler temperatures and crisp mornings, I have always looked forward to autumn.  Getting an early taste of it today makes starting the work-week just a little more palatable.
