[![Technorati](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-27-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/picture-27.png)It's day 4 of my [marketing challenge](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/06/16/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/) where I'm demonstrating how to build traffic to your business website.

1. I just finished reading John Reese's [article](http://www.income.com/blog/2007/06/18/heres-the-big-secret-to-becoming-an-internet-millionaire/) on working with others to grow your business, and it sparked some ideas.  I sent off two interview requests to successful entrepreneurs that I know (one has already accepted).  Hopefully they will be appearing on this site over the next week or so.  I realized that offering an interview is a great way to get great content other than my own thoughts, and it also will help build traffic because typically the interviewee will tell others about their interview!  In many cases they even link to it from their own website.  Thats what I call win-win.



2. I ran the site through some tools at [SEOMoz.org](http://www.seomoz.org).  Unfortunately it looks like most of their tools are part of their paid service now, but I was able to uncover and fix one problem with my meta tags showing incorrectly on the homepage.

3. Installed the [Ultimate Tag Warrior](http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior) plug in for WordPress.  This improves meta keywords by offering suggestions, and should improve rankings in the [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) blog search engine.
