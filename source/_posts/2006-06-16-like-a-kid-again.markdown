I have been exhausted all week long and consequently have been going to bed very early, even for me. The last two nights I've been in bed well before nine p.m., and last night I was asleep before then.

Going to bed while it is still light outside is something I haven't done since I was a little boy. Lying there, in the half light coming around the window blind, hearing sounds of people still outside, brought back memories of a simpler time in my life.

Remember those heady days at the beginning of summer after school was out for the year, when every day was a Saturday, and the next day was filled with the promise of new adventures and fun? I know that the world wasn't truly simpler in 1967 or 1970, but as a boy of seven or ten I was blissfully unaware of life's realities.

What I wouldn't give for just one day of blissful ignorance again today.
