A while back I read an article that described 14 characteristics of fascism using the likes of Hitler, Mussolini, and others as examples. What was chilling about the piece were the parallels to present day America. You can read my <a href="http://www.zanshin.net/blogs/000452.html" title="Fascism Scorecard">Fascism Scorecard</a>, and see for yourself.

Yesterday I stumbled across this <a href="http://austinuu.org/sermons/2004/2004-11-07-LivingUnderFascism.html" title="Living Under Fascism">sermon</a> by Davidson Loehr, a Unitarian Universalist minister in Austin Texas. It is the clearest, and consequently most chilling, explanation of America's descent into fascism.

I urge your to read it and pass it on to your friends.
