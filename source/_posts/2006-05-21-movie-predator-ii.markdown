<i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0100403/" title="PredatorII">Predator II</a></i> isn't nearly as good as the original. The acting is a bit forced, and the whole "LA as a war zone" was way overdone.

Rating: Skip this one and go straight to <i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0370263/" title="AVP">AVP</a></i>
