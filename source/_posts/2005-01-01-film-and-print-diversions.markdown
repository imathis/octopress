<a href="http://musicplasma.com/" title="De-lovely">De-lovely</a> is a wonderful musical love-story. Kevin Kline astounds as Cole Porter in this de-lightfully presented story of his life, his music, and his love.

<hr width="25%" /><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0391024/" title="Control Room">Control Room</a> is a documentary about the most important television station in the Arab world, if not the entire world: Al Jazeera. Thought provoking and unflinching, this important film shows us that there is always another side to the stories our media and our government present.

<hr width="25%" /><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0403910/" title="Bush's Brain">Bush's Brain</a> is the film version of the book by the same name. Focusing on Karl Rove this film paints a picture of the power behind the power, of the man who for all intents an purposes is co-president. If you want to understand one of the key figures shaping the political landscape in America today, you need to include this film on your list.

UPDATED: 1.2.2005: I've added a <a href="http://zanshin.net/diversions.php" title="Diversions">whole new page</a> to track the books and films I watch this year. Films are entered on the day they are watched, books on the day they are started.
