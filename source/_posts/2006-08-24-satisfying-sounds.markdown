<ul>
<li class="il">The pop-fizzle of an icy cold soda can being opened.</li>&nbsp;
<li class="il">The pregnant pause between the flash of lightning and the crash of thunder.</li>&nbsp;
<li class="il">The purr of a contented cat</li>&nbsp;
<li class="il">A camera shutter releasing.</li>&nbsp;
<li class="il">The be-boop GMail makes when new mail from someone special arrives.</li>&nbsp;
</ul>
