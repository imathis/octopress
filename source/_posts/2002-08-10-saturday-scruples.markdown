1. In a "must win football game, your coach tells you to target the rival quarterback's recent knee injury. Do you obey? No. Absolutely not. In fact I quit the team and report the coach's lack of concern for other humans to the school administration.

2. Your cool new look gets you nowhere because your best friend looks like trailer trash. Do you avoid being seen with him/her? No. Friendship is based on more than looks.

3. When a young waitress leans forward to wipe tables, you have a magnificent view not meant for you. Do you keep looking? No. I'm married so I get all the magnificent views I want.
