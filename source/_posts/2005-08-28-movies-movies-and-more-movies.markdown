With the primary Tivo on the <a href="http://www.zanshin.net/blogs/000621.html" title="Welcome. Powering up...">fritz</a> we've been watching movies. Lots of movies.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0379225/" title="The Corporation">The Corporation</a></strong>
A very engrossing look at corporations in America and their impact on the lives of people both here and abroad. One of the scariest things this documentary revealed is the use of Prosilac to increase dairy milk production - even though it isn't needed and it may <em>introduce disease causing pathogens</em> in milk. Highly recommended.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0312549" title="Veronica Guerin">Veronica Guerin</a></strong>
Based on the true story of one journalists battle to expose drug corruption in Ireland. A grim, harsh look at the impact drugs have on society.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0038494" title="Sherlock Holmes: Dressed to Kill">Sherlock Holmes: Dressed to Kill</a></strong>
The last Sherlock Holmes to star Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Not overly long on plot or characterizations, but good fun nonetheless.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0037988" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></strong>
The first time I saw this I watched it on a black and white television. It was shot in black and white after all. Except for one or two scenes where color is used to great effect.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0164912" title="Stuart Little">Stuart Little</a></strong>
Good, clean family safe fun. With the Tivo out of service we sorted all 229 DVD titles and in the process we discovered some we hadn't watched in a while. This was one. The next three were others that caught our eye in the alphabetizing effort.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0086960" title="Beverly Hills Cop">Beverly Hills Cop</a></strong>
I remember seeing this when it first came out in 1984. At the time I had recently completed college and was working my first programming job. Eddie is only a month older than I, and I was struck by his fame at a tender age. The movie is a little dated now but still enjoyable.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0305669" title="Bringing Down the House">Bringing Down the House</a></strong>
A great comedy that allows Queen Latifah to strut her stuff. Steve Martin, as usual, plays the every man caught in over his head role very well.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0091877" title="Ruthless People">Ruthless People</a></strong>
A great vehicle for both Bette Midler and Danny DeVito. I hadn't seen this in years and it was funny all over again.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0417001" title="Must Love Dogs">Must Love Dogs</a></strong>
A good little romantic comedy, I actually almost cheered when Diane Lane's character finally takes the plunge and goes after John Cusack. Michele and I discovered that the local theater has an early (before noon) matinee on Sunday's that is usually deserted. Movies like this are fun again since the theater is largely empty at 11:50 am.

<strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0036342" title="Shadow of a Doubt">Shadow of a Doubt</a></strong>
From the master, Alfred Hitchcock, with a carefully crafted presentation and precise camera angles. When people say that movies aren't made like they used to be anymore, this is the kind of movie to which they are referring.
