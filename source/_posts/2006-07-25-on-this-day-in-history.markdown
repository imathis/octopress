Nine years ago this evening I was at the rehearsal dinner for my wedding. Friends and family had gathered from Florida, Tennessee, Massachusetts, and Illinois to help us celebrate the occasion. The experience was heady and surreal, exciting and scary, wonderful and beautiful.

Nine years ago tomorrow, July 26, was my wedding day. I was able to stand in front of the people who were most important in my life and declare my intentions publicly. My memories of that day are snapshots, slices of people, words, and emotions. Like all weddings ours had some drama, some tragedy, a little comedy, and a whole lot of love. The best part was afterwards; having a house full of out of town guests sharing in our laughter and joy.

Tomorrow will be the first time I've crossed July 26 without being married in nine years. Tomorrow I will be one again, newborn and fragile. Struggling to find a way to make sense of this new world I've been born into. Learning and growing, setting aside the past but keeping the memories. Building a future on what came before.

There is an old saying, "what the caterpillar calls death the butterfly calls birth." Michele's caterpillar transitioned away from this world leaving me and mine behind. Tomorrow I will shed another layer of my chrysalis. Tomorrow I will continue my journey through life.
