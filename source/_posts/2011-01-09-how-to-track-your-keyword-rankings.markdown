Remember [Seoaholic.com](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/get-your-website-to-1-in-google-with-seoaholic-com/)?

It was an SEO tool  that my friend Chad DePue contracted me to build while I was living down in Argentina.

Chad has since rebranded it (with what I must say is a much better name :) and relaunched it as [InboxSEO.com](http://inboxseo.com/?q=1).

There are some new features, it's faster and more reliable, and the interface looks a lot better.  He's done a great job on it.

InboxSEO tells you how your site is ranking in search engines for a variety of keywords, and delivers a report right to your inbox on a daily/monthly/weekly basis (however often you'd like).

I've actually been using it on my own projects, both for CarWoo.com and UniversityTutor.com, and it has come in handy.

One thing that is really useful is if I make some site wide changes (either in the headers or in the structure of a large number of pages) then I can see what the effect is overall in Google.  Individual pages tend to fluctuate a lot, but the overall change is often visible in InboxSEO.

I've also used this to watch a bunch of my pages go into the "Google sandbox" and then come back out a month later.  (The Google Sanbox is simply a manual review process that Google sometimes puts new pages through.)

Anyway, it's not free but the cheapest plan is only $9/month - and you can try it free for 30 days.  Head on over and [check it out](http://inboxseo.com/?q=1).  And if you have any feedback for Chad feel free to leave a comment below.
