Sometime tomorrow, June 13, 2011, the total number of page views on my humble little site will cross 100,000. This drop in the vast ocean of Internet statistics is likely important to know one but me, but it is important to me. That I've had a voice here for over 15 years, and that an ever increasing number of people comes to listen what I have to share pleases me.

Thank you to everyone who visits zanshin.net.
