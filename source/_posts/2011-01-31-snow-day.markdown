The university where I work was closed today in anticipation of a major snow storm. So far, with just an hour of the day left, the storm hasn't amounted to anything. There's a bit of ice from some early morning freezing drizzle, but no snow.

The forecast for tomorrow is far worse than the one for today was, so I will be surprised if we are at work tomorrow. However, campus hasn't been officially closed yet. I'll have to set the alarm for the usual 6:20 am and check my messages to find out.
