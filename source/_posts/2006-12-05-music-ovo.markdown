For several years I have been aware there was a Peter Gabriel album called <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/OVO-Millennium-Show-Peter-Gabriel/dp/B0000DEODI/sr=8-1/qid=1165348101/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-2598303-1862327?ie=UTF8&s=music" title="Ovo">Ovo</a></i> available. Only not in the US. There were some partial, usually poor quality, rips floating around the Internet of the CD but nothing complete.

Just this past week I decided to look on Amazon again and discovered an import version of the CD. Several of the songs made it into the second round of touring done in support of <i>Up</i> and are on the concert DVD produced from that tour.

<i>Ovo</i> is vintage Peter Gabriel, exploring new soundscapes and aural signatures.

Rating: Very satisfying and worth owning
