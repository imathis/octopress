As we approach the next anniversary of Nine-Eleven I have this thought.

15 of the 19 individuals involved in the hijackings and subsequent attacks on New York City and Washington were Saudi Arabians. So naturally we attacked Afghanistan and then Iraq.

What if 15 of the 19 individuals had been North Korean? Would we have invaded Japan? South Korea? If they had been Columbian would we have invaded Cuba?

My point is that there are really only two motives in the world: money and love. We, as a country, pay enormous sums to the Saudis for oil. America, like a petulant teenager, knows when not to bite the hand that feeds it.

What chaps my ass is that we give lip service to fighting terrorist while shipping money by the boatload to a country that open supports terrorists.

I just don't get it.
