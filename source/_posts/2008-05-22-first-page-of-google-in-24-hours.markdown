Hey Folks,

I've had some good success lately with Jeff Johnson's [video distribution techniques](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/jj).

A few days ago I made this little 2 minute video demonstrating my new site:


Then I targeted my most competitive keyword ("austin tutors") by putting this in the title and tags of the video.

Then I went to put it online.  Normally I just upload my videos to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/bdarmstrong1) since this is the most popular site.  But taking Jeff's advice, I uploaded it to [Tube Mogul](http://www.tubemogul.com) instead, which automatically uploads it to about 10 different video sharing sites (including YouTube).

This in and of itself is pretty valuable because it takes the exact same amount of time to upload it to TubeMogul as it does to YouTube, except uploading it to TubeMogul gets you maybe 5x the distribution for the same amount of effort.  It would take me about 30 minutes per site to do it individually.

Heres the proof, it uploaded the same video to [Yahoo](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/2694339/7862043), [MySpace](http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=2111398470), [MetaCafe](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1322632/), [Google](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3160622116978808884), [Revver](http://one.revver.com/watch/893892), [AOL](http://uncutvideo.aol.com/videos/5eec94461c496d1c85064746429ba7a9), [DailyMotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5gmq4), [Blip](http://www.blip.tv/file/915336), [Veoh](http://www.veoh.com/videos/v11368067n4J7bswD), and [HowCast](http://www.howcast.com/videos/9136-Austin-Tutors-Where-To-Find-the-Best-Tutors-in-Austin-TX).

Within 24 hours I was seeing some of these video pages show up in Google search results for "austin tutors" (most on the 2nd and 3rd pages).  Obviously Google likes these video sharing sites because normally my webpages would take 2 weeks to get updated by Google, but these were getting picked up within 24 hours.

One of them (the AOL video) got on the first page for a bit for my main keyword, then went back to page 2.

The next step was social bookmarking...

I added my video (the YouTube one) to a bunch of social bookmarking sites like Digg, Stumbleupon, and Delicious.  I actually did this at 32 different social bookmarking sites using a tool called [SocialMarker](http://www.socialmarker.com).  Now 24 hours later, the YouTube video is on the first page of Google (#5) for my main keyword "austin tutors".

I have never seen results this fast!

Will it stay there?  I have no idea.  But still that is pretty impressive.  It's almost as good as getting my actual homepage on the first page of Google because people will see the video as a testimonial I think and hopefully then go to the website.  I'm going to try bookmarking some other ones (and my main site) to see if I can get more on the first page.

Using this technique I think it would be possible to get a whole bunch of links on the first page of Google.  Still waiting to see if these results last though.  I hope so.

I had never heard of Jeff Johnson before this, but I'll be [keeping a closer eye on his stuff](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/jj) from now on.
