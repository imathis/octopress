Just wanted to give an update on how my SEO experiment went from [this post a month ago](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-best-books-for-entrepreneurs/).

For those who didn't read it I setup a category on [BuyersVote.com](http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-halloween-costume-ideas-2009-reviews) for the best halloween costume ideas of 2009.  I did this because I knew it would be a popular keyword in October, especially toward the end of the month.  And if I could make a good page targeted specifically for that niche keyword, it might get some traffic.

Well, it worked.  I just BARELY got on the first page of Google in time for Halloween and managed to get the 9th or 10th place listing (which is still on the first page) for some costume related keywords.  It was enough to triple the traffic to BuyersVote.com for a month (which isn't saying much given how little it was before, but still, you have to start somewhere ;).

Here is the graph from Google Analytics.

Check out the keywords which drove all the traffic.

It's also interesting to note that I think my [page](http://buyersvote.com/categories/best-halloween-costume-ideas-2009-reviews) actually had the best content of any of the top 10 listings.  Most of the other pages were made-for-adsense sites or crappy articles without many good costume ideas.  It shows you that crowd-sourced content works, even on a small scale.

So what did I learn from this experiment?  Primarily it shows this could be a good growth strategy for BuyersVote.  With just a few good niche review topics like [Ski Resort Reviews](http://buyersvote.com/categories/u-s-ski-resorts-reviews), [Blogs for Entrepreneurs](http://buyersvote.com/categories/blogs-for-entrepreneurs-reviews), or [Mac Web Browser Reviews](http://buyersvote.com/categories/web-browsers-for-mac-reviews) it could start to get some good organic search results.  If I get just a few, that will be enough to start getting new contributors to the site who will generate new topics, and new search results, and it will be come a positive feedback loop to growth.

This is the hardest part about starting a site like this: critical mass.  Nobody wants to be the first reviewer on an empty site.

Feel free to steal this SEO idea too (I didn't come up with it) and apply it to your own site.  Basically just pick a highly specialized keyword (so it's not too competitive) that will have a lot of traffic coming up.  Seasonal or holiday related keywords work well for this.  Then if you generate a page targeted to just that keyword, it's possible to get on the first page of Google, even if you have a relatively new or unknown site.

**What do you think?  What might be some other good niche topics to add to BuyersVote.com?**

By the way, the site now has 405 items and 113 contributors, so if you haven't already, please take a moment to [create an account](http://buyersvote.com/user_session/new) and add some reviews.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
