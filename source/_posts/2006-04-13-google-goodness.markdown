For the past two years I have been a daily user of Google's GMail service. I was never impressed with Microsoft Hotmail and I have a strong dislike for Yahoo's invasion-ware tactics when you install their chat client, so I was pleased to discover a simple, easy to use, and very slick web-based mail tool. (I have invitations if anyone would like.)

When Google introduced their homepage I immediately set one up for myself and it has been my starting point ever since. So when I learned a few weeks ago that Google was developing a web-based calendar I couldn't wait to try it. As of an hour ago my patience was rewarded. My daily visit to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/" title="TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a> paid off as the lead <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/12/google-calendar-is-live/" title="Google Calendar is Live">story</a> was about the launch of Goolge's Calendar beta.

My initial impression is a good one. I was able to successfully import all my iCal ics files (something <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html" title="Mozilla's Sunbird ">Mozilla's Sunbird</a> and <a href="http://chandler.osafoundation.org/" title="OSAF's Chandler ">OSAF's Chandler</a>have consistently failed to accomplish) although I haven't been able to create separate calendars yet.
