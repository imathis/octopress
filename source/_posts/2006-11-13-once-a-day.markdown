Writing something at least once a day on ones web site is not as easy (for me anyway) as it sounds. There are days when I have several ideas for things to write about and share via my site. I'd venture to say that maybe half of all the ideas I get never make it to the screen. Either because I start the posting and decide that I don't want to share it, or because the idea happens when I am not conveniently in front of my computer, ready to type away. Many a good posting has been composed while standing in the shower or driving the car; only to be lost in the same way half remembered dreams are lost upon waking.

So today's posting is really a posting, except that it fulfills (technically) the need to put something new on my site for November 13, 2006.
