Today, I made a guest post on [SmashingMagazine's website](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/22/how-to-communicate-design-decisions-to-clients/) and it looks like it sparked some controversy!

Many readers as a result have come to this website.  This is a good example of how [guest posts](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/conclusion/) can help you build readership.

Check out the [article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/22/how-to-communicate-design-decisions-to-clients/) when you get a chance, and for SmashingMagazine readers, hopefully this site can help you out if you've ever thought about working for yourself.  It's easy to [subscribe](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/subscribe/) to get future updates (and get 3 free books in the process).  Thanks for stopping by!
