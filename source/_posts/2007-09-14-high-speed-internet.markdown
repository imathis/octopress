Several times in recent weeks the wireless broadband card I have from Sprint has been pressed into service while traveling in the car.  The I-70 corridor from Kansas City west to at least K-177 (the Manhattan exit) has good data coverage.  With Sibylle driving the car I've been able to connect, view emails, chat, even VPN into my workstation at work and accomplish tasks "at" work.

Last evening Sibylle got a chance to try this marvel out for herself, while I was driving.  We both agreed that it is at the same time amazing and, almost, expected.  Of course we can be online in a car traveling 70 mph on the highway, why would it work any other way?
