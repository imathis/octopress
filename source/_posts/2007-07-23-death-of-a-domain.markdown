With absolutely no fanfare one of my domains died over the weekend.  The site had been languishing for more than a year and it had never really been active; either in a visitor sense or as an advertisement for my company.  I am of two minds about it being gone, I miss the idea of it and I am glad to be past it.

In a very real sense it represented one possible path for my life to take.  That path was littered with obstacles and challenges, and resulted in some major setbacks professionally and financially.  I've picked up the pieces and moved on so letting go of the site is a good thing in a sense.  Still, it is odd to know that partitionsoftware.com no longer leads to me.

Eventually I'll have another website, one that more closely aligns with my professional goals today.  For now though, I am satisfied to be just zanshin.net.
