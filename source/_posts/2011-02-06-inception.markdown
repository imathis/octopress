Yesterday, while returning <em><a title="Social Network" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/" target="_blank">Social Network</a></em> at the nearby Redbox, I saw that <em><a title="Inception" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/" target="_blank">Inception</a></em> was available so I grabbed a copy of it. Talk about a mind-altering movie. Wow. This has the same kick as <em><a title="The Matrix" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/" target="_blank">The Matri</a>x</em> did when it was brand new. And like <em><a title="The Matrix" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/" target="_blank">The Matrix</a></em>, this will take a re-watching or three to fully grasp and understand.

I also like that it had a hint of a <em><a title="The Sting" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070735/" target="_blank">Sting</a></em> ending with the spinning top on the table. Did it wobble there at the end? Was it going to fall down, or was it going to keep spinning forever?

Oh, and <em><a title="Social Network" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/" target="_blank">Social Network</a></em> was pretty good too. You almost feel sorry for Mark Zuckerburg by the end. Almost.
