Twitter is currently trying sponsored trending topics, ads, and licensing deals to see if they can monetize their platform.  But there is a much simpler business model right in front of them: freemium.

Make it free for up to 10,000 followers.  If you have more than that, it's $5 a month.  Over 100,000 followers maybe $49 a month.  Over a million followers $99 a month.  Etc.

The exact numbers aren't important.  This tiered business model is proven to work by lots of [companies](http://www.aweber.com/pricing.htm), and anyone with that many followers is clearly deriving some sort of benefit that they should pay for.

This business model is so obvious - why haven't they tried it?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills over here.  What am I missing?
