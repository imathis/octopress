<ul>
<li>I have a new wireless mouse that I like very much. Once less cord on my desk is nice.</li>
<li>The new mouse does suffer from a slight lag when it hasn't been moved for a while. It has some power saving features that mean it doesn't respond immediately upon being moved.</li>
<li>Wireless connectivity is bitchin'.</li>
<li>Not having a wireless access point while having an Aircard in one's Powerbook is putting the cart before the horse. Well, it's having the horse and no cart.</li>
<li>Sharing a wired connection via your Aircard to a friend's iBook, and then surfing the Internet from your living room is way cool.</li>
</ul>
