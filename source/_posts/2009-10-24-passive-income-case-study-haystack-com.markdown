The 37Signals guys launched a new site this week called [Haystack.com](http://haystack.com/).  Here is their [post](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1976-launch-haystack-a-better-way-for-web-designers-to-find-clients-and-for-clients-to-find-web-designers) explaining the launch.

It's a simple idea: create a directory of website design companies so clients can quickly find a good one to work with.

The idea is not particularly brilliant and original, but they absolutely nailed the execution on this project.  Let's look at a few reasons why this is going to be (and already is) a big success.

At the end I'll show you exactly how much money they're making from this just a few days after launch (it's a lot).

**1. It's Passive**

The first reason this business makes sense is that you build it once and it runs on it's own.  You aren't trading hours for dollars working with individual clients.  What time you do spent on it after launch is spent ON the business, not IN the business.  This is an important distinction and one of the keys to [building wealth](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-secret-to-working-less-producing-more-and-getting-rich/).

**2. Freemium**

They also used my favorite business model on the web: freemium.  People can try it free, but if you want some additional benefits they ask you to upgrade for $99 per month. 

This might be worth it to any web design company who gets at least that much new business from it each month.  It's basically a marketing tool for them.


What's particularly impressive here is that I think they NAILED the breakdown in benefits between free and paid accounts.  They didn't try some gimmicky upgrades like a "pro" badge or a 30 day free trial.  Paid accounts get three things:



	
  * six images to show your work instead of one (this reminds me of AutoTrader.com)

	
  * listings in search results above free users

	
  * a bigger display of your work than free accounts (the image is 4x as big)


That last one (size) I've never seen in any other freemium model and I think it works great here since they are displaying creative work.

(Side note: another freemium benefit which works really well is an upgrade based on storage, or amount of usage like number of users/projects/invoices sent/etc.  DropBox, Flickr, Evernote, Basecamp, etc all use this with great effect, and it works much better than a 30 day trial or something like that.)

**3. Permission Asset: Their Blog**

The final reason they nailed this is that they have a lot of clout in this field (website design) and their blog has over 100,000 readers.

It's hard to overstate the importance of this.

The site launched just a few days ago and you can already see on the homepage they have 72 paying customers with big listings (and hundreds of free accounts).  **That means the site is already generating over $7,128 per month in profit and it's just a few days old.**

What would it have cost to buy this much interest in advertising dollars in just a few days?  $100k?  $500k?  I have no idea.  Maybe it wouldn't even be possible.  People don't put much faith in ads and $99/month is a lot of money.  But they got this "advertising" for FREE just by making one blog post.  Of course it took them years to built up that asset (their blog) to get it there.  And they didn't fake it by writing cookie cutter, me too, articles.  They wrote really useful stuff from the heart.

The message is clear: if you don't have a blog, you need to create one today and start building a relationship with people who know and trust you.  Communicate as personally and authentically as possible.  That way, the next time you are doing something important (a talk, a new business, a book, etc) you have a built in audience.

**Conclusion**

As someone who has a similar business - after all [UniversityTutor.com](http://www.UniversityTutor.com) is just another directory site, I'm providing tutors with a way to get new business instead of web design companies - watching the Haystack.com launch gave me a couple new ideas.

Primarily, it's made me wonder if I have the right breakdown between free and paid tutors accounts on my site.  Currently, I let tutors get the first 3 job requests free, then ask them to upgrade for $10/month.  This worked much [better](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-evolution-of-a-business-model-never-stop-testing/) than a 30 day free trial but still has a problem: tutors who don't want to pay at that point get kicked off the site!

Currently there are about 7,000 tutors with live profiles on the site.  But there are an additional 5,000 tutors who USED to have a profile on the site but they decided not to pay after 3 job requests and got booted off the site.  That means I'd have almost twice as many listings if those tutors hadn't been kicked off (or more accurately, the number of listings would be growing twice as fast over time).  It's also probably hurts the number of [tutor signups](http://www.universitytutor.com/tutoring_jobs) you get in the first place if people know there is a ticking time bomb on their account (3 jobs left, 2 jobs left, 1 job left...boom!  pay up or your account is gone).

So what is the solution?  This made me wonder if there are different benefits I could provide for the paid tutor account that didn't involve a deadline.  How about...



	
  * Get listed first in search results (yes, maybe)

	
  * List more pictures (no, doesn't work here)

	
  * Bigger profile (no, probably not as important here - photos don't matter as much in tutoring)

	
  * Offer more storage, or bandwidth on the site (no, doesn't work in this case)

	
  * Make the job requests limited some other way, like max 1 per month, but you can do that forever with the free account  (maybe...)


I'm not sure, what do you think?  Getting listed first in search results sounds like a good one, and I might add that anyway (even if I keep the same business model).  But I'm not sure if that alone would be enough to convince people to upgrade.

Making a limited number of job requests per month (every month, with no deadline) is an interesting one.  This works well for sites like FaxZero.com, where you can only send a limited number of faxes with the free account but you can do so forever without upgrading.  So a "light" user gets hooked on it for free, but if they need to start sending more faxes it's a natural upgrade.  But would this work for tutoring?  There is a relatively high turnover in tutoring, so you need to keep getting new students, but it's not like faxes.  Getting just a couple good regular students could be all you need for a while.

**What do you think?  Have I struck the right balance with UniversityTutor's business model or is there a way to offer a free account without a deadline and curb the number of tutors getting booted off the site?**

Until next time, keep breaking free,
Brian Armstrong
