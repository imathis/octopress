title: How To Get A Business Website Built For Cheap Or Free

Breaking Free reader "tormcgraw" posted this excellent question to the [Breaking Free Forum](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/?page_id=418&forumaction=doeditpost&forum=4&thread=45&start=0&forumpost=152).  I thought others might find it useful:



> I have had an idea for a website business very similar to universitytutor.com but with a different industry. I have conducted research with parties that would utilize this service and indication is they would utilize the service. My fear is that since I do not have web design experience, it will cost thousands of dollars (that I don’t have) to produce the site. And because it will involve profiles, ratings, driving directions, etc., I would guess it would be expensive! Is there any advice or potential services that would be helpful. Thanks and any feedback would be greatly appreciated.



Here is my response:

Hi Torrey,

I have a few ideas that could allow you to get it done for cheap or for free:

**Cheap**
You may want to look at outsourcing websites like [odesk.com](http://www.odesk.com) or [guru.com](http://www.guru.com). These will allow you to post your idea and get bids from programmers all over the world to build it.  Some bids will be cheaper than you might expect since they live in countries like India and the Philippines (maybe as low as $5 per hour).  The quality varies here though, so read their feedback and give them a small project first to see how good they are. It could potentially be done for less than $1000, depending on what you need.

**Cheaper**
You could try a pre-built tool like [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) and then add a “ratings” plugin for it like [this one](http://lesterchan.net/wordpress/readme/wp-postratings.html).  There are actually tons of plugins for wordpress so you might be able to put together a lot of those features you mentioned.  It's open source software so it is for the most part entirely free.  The only downside to this is two fold: (1) It won't be as customizable as designing it from scratch - you might not be able to get EXACTLY what you want but pretty close.  (2) You need to be somewhat tech savvy to get all these plugins working.  You won't need to be a programmer, but tech savvy yes.  If it gets too crazy, you can always hire someone as in the first option but only for a few hours to help you with wordpress so it should be much cheaper.

**Free**
Find a programmer and offer him equity (percent ownership in the business) in exchange for building the site.  I would look for a current college student (computer science major) to do this - college students are great programmers but still young and hungry and would go for this type of thing more than a programmer who already has a job at a big company.

None of these methods will be an overnight instant success, but few things worth doing in life are.  If it was easy then someone probably would have already done it by now, and would be raking in all the cash from YOUR idea :)  The fact that it's a little bit difficult is actually great, it makes a barrier to all those other people who don't want it as badly as you do!

Hope this helps,
Brian
