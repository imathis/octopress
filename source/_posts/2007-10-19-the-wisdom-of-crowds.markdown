<a href="http://karmatics.com/docs/evolution-and-wisdom-of-crowds.html" title="Evolution and The Wisdom of Crowds">Evolution and the Wisdom of Crowds</a> is a fascinating look at how the process of selection works behind the scenes to make predictive models work.  The author uses Wikipedia, predictive markets, and Netflix's recommendation system as examples of processes relying upon selection to work, producing results that are counter-intuitive.

He uses these examples as excellent analogies to evolution and makes the thesis that at least some of the resistance to the theory of evolution is a result of the hard to conceptualize process of selection.

Excellent.
