Lately I've been functional, but not creative. I'm able to get through daily activities, if only because I've done them before. But any activity that requires creativity or thought, and I'm out of luck. Meals are difficult to think up, prepare, and quite frankly, consume. I've been resorting to lists in order to accomplish anything. It is isn't written down in a moment of lucidity, it isn't likely to happen.

Thank God for 3M sticky notes.
