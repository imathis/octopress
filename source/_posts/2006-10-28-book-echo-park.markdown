Michael Connelly has long been one of my favorite authors, his Harry Bosch series is excellent. His latest installment, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Park-Harry-Bosch-Michael-Connelly/dp/0316734950/sr=8-1/qid=1162054536/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-8413221-1892010?ie=UTF8&s=books" title="Echo Park">Echo Park</a></i>, is no exception.
