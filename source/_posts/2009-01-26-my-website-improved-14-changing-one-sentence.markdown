Hey Folks,

I decided to do a video blog today to show you a recent change I made to my passive income business, [UniversityTutor.com](http://www.universitytutor.com).  For those of you who haven't been following the blog for a while, I launched this business in [about 1 month with $100](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/).

I only changed one sentence on the website - and this led to a 14% improvement in my conversion rate.  Imagine if you could get a 14% raise at your job for changing one sentence?

[Check out the video](http://www.veoh.com/videos/v17333233kae9xnct) to see how I did it (watch in fullscreen for best view).

Takeaways:



	
  * Put yourself in the mindset of your customer

	
  * Try to look at your website with "fresh eyes" or show it to new people and get them to "think out loud" as they go through it.  No helping them when they can't figure something out!  You have to watch in silence which will be very difficult but revealing.

	
  * Test, test, test - little ongoing improvements like this can end up being huge contributors to your bottom line as they add up quickly.



Until next time, keep breaking free!
