I haven't done a friday five in a long time, but I ran across this set of questions today, and wanted to post my answers. So here goes:

1. What was the last song you heard?
"Hurts to Hear" by Stephanie Quayle

2. What were the last two movies you saw?
At home: Open Range and Secondhand Lions
In the theater: Lord of The Rings: Return of the King, and Matrix Revolutions

3. What were the last three things you purchased?
Tootsie Pops, Xerox Multi-purpose paper, frozen chicken strips (gotta love Sam's Club.)

4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?
Visit Sam's club (done). Install SuSE Linux on old PC to use a ssh server (in progress). Travel to brother's house for niece's 3rd birthday party (later today). And last, but not least, make chilli and a chocolate frosted yellow cake (on tap tomorrow.)

5. Who are the last five people you talked to?
My wife <a href="http://andifyoudidknow.com/" title="And If You Did Know?">Michele</a>, my nephew AJ, a coworker, Dave, another coworker Bob, and my boss, Tony.
