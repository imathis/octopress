Roughly two months ago it occurred to me to take some body measurements so that I would know how much size I had lost in addition to the number of pounds. Acquiring a tailors tape I added a new page to my Hacker's Diet Spreadsheet and started measuring.

I decided to track the following measurements: Neck, Upper Chest, Bust, Waist, Hips, Thigh, Calf, and Biceps. And in that order here are the amounts I've lost in the last eight weeks:

1 inch, 3.75 inches, 2 inches, 4.5 inches, 2 inches, 1 inch, 1 inch, and .25 inches.

More than one person has now told me that I need to buy new clothes (or have some of my current wardrobe taken in), and with these losses I can see why.

Twenty-six pounds and four and a half inches in eleven weeks. Hot-damn-diggity.
