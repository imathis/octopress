The whole idea of retirement is based on the assumption that you dislike what you're doing enough to want to stop one day.

Instead, you should be pursuing "financial freedom" - the moment when your passive income exceeds your living expenses - because then you can really start to do your life's work.  Maybe you'll try to cure malaria like Bill Gates.  Or maybe your "work" will be for a charity that doesn't pay a dime.  Whatever it is, I guarantee you won't have retirement on your mind because you'll enjoy it too much.
