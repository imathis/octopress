[![Entrepreneurship Education Wikipedia](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/eeducation1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/eeducation1.png)This is day 29 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new traffic to this website.  It's been a long journey and it's almost done demonstrating that [blogging can be a profitable and inexpensive business to start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/)!

Here are my three tasks for the day...



### 1. Contributed to "Entrepreneurship Resource" Directories



I started off today by doing a google search for "entrepreneurship resources".  One of the best results I found was this page on [Ryan Allis' Zero Million site](http://www.zeromillion.com).  So I submitted a few articles that I've written.

By the way Ryan is a master of building website traffic as you can see by his outstanding rankings in Google.  He wrote a free [eBook on the subject](http://www.zeromillion.com/pdf/building-links.pdf), and while I think his strategy worked for him (basically email website owners and asking for links, on a mass scale), it's probably not as effective today.  Website owners have seen too many link request emails like and consider it spam at this point.

Try typing "[your industry] resources" into Google and see where people are looking for good content.





### 2. Answered Some Questions on Yahoo Answers



I decided to answer some [questions](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070718210826AACZVpl&r=w&pa=FZptHWf.BGRX3OFMiTBdUoo8nvX9RYQNpMU64Kp_lK48o_6l0g--&paid=answered#RpxsDzS1LUzneUZZquaU) on Yahoo Answers.  This is good way to help people and you can also include your link!



### 3. Wikipedia



Google loves Wikipedia links (you see them ranked highly in all sorts of search results).  So I decided to see if there was a legitimate reason to add my website into a Wikipedia article.  Just adding it haphazardly won't help because Wikipedia has such a large community of people patrolling their articles that irrelevant links will be removed within a few hours.

So anyway, I found this article on [entrepreneurship education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship_education) and added the following sentence:




> There are also non-profit organizations such as SCORE, government programs such as the Small Business Association, and blog websites.



I included references to SCORE, the SBA, and my website.  I'm actually surprised it didn't have that information in the article about SCORE and the SBA.  Those are both great resources.  We'll see if it stays in or gets edited out.
