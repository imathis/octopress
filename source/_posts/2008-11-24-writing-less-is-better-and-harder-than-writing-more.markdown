This weekend I read [Skinny Bitch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762424931?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0762424931) (don't recommend it) and [The Dip](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841666?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwstartb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591841666) (highly recommend it).

Both were short, tiny little books with big type.  A few years ago I would have looked down on these books because I figured the author was trying sell a whole book with half the material.

I don't see it that way now because I know it is harder and more valuable to be concise.

In fact, the first time I wrote that last sentence, I wrote it as: "But now I don't see it that way at all, because I know it is harder and often much more valuable to say something in fewer words."

Being concise gets your message across more powerfully and memorably.  It's respectful of other people's time.  And it often requires you to write just as much as a long winded version - except you take out all of the crap and leave only your best material behind.

I like (and am much more likely to read) short blog posts and short emails.  I believe it was Ben Franklin (?) who once apologized for writing such a long letter - he did not have the time to choose his words carefully and write a short one.

After writing an email today, see what can be taken out and still convey your message.  It will make your writing better.
