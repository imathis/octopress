In the world of software construction, <i>refactoring</i> is the activity whereby code is modified or enhanced. Perhaps you discovered that two separate pieces of code are performing the same function; you create a new home for the common code, remove it from the two original locations and replace it there with a call to the new, shared routine. You have refactored the code.

Some refactorings I am currently working on:
<ul>
<li class="il">I'm putting all the open source development software I use on the Intel machine under <b>c:\usr\local</b> to mimic its location in the Unix-y world of my Mac. </li>
<li class="il">I no longer tote two laptops to work every day. I'm still getting used to this and I may start again soon. It seems there is always something on the <i>other</i> machine that I want or need. </li>
<li class="il">Tracking personal finances more diligently. I've been too lax too long about this.   </li>
<li class="il">Reducing clutter. There's too much junk in boxes in my life. Unless it's a seasonal thing like Christmas decorations, or seldom used items (but <i>still</i> used), it's getting tossed </li>
<li class="il">This website. The design is stale to me now, and the underpinnings ancient. Time to pay the piper and upgrade. </li>
</ul>

What are you refactoring in your life?
