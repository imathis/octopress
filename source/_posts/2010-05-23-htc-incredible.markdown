Shortly before 4 pm this afternoon I became the proud owner of a receipt for a HTC Incredible from Verizon. The actual device will ship in about 2 1/2 weeks on June 11th. Until then I'll have to amuse myself with pictures online and the Android Emulator.

What I need now is an Android countdown widget. Oh, and Android phone to run it.
