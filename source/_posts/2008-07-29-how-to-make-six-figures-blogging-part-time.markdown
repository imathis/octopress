I've been watching [Yaro Starak's](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/yaro) stuff for a while, and he has had some great success over the last year or two.  I've seen his blog go from just a few thousand subscribers to now over 30,000, and he has a very similar niche to this site: entrepreneurship.

What's cool is that Yaro now consistently makes over $10,000 per month from his blog.  And he does it working less than 2 hours per day.  He has "broken free".

Blogging is a pretty cool business model.  It's certainly not easy though.  And it can take several years to really get a blog to the point where it's making money.

As I've said before, I think the key is to **pick a topic that you would write about whether anyone is reading your blog or not**.  Essentially, use your blog like a private journal where you would write your own thoughts and ideas for your own benefit.

Because when you first start out it REALLY WILL be for only your own benefit since you will likely have very few readers.

The people who fail at blogging are people who write about something they don't really care about.  They will try it for a month or two and then give up before it really starts to pay off.

That being said, Yaro has released some really cool videos lately that show some of the tricks he has used to become a successful blogger.  The videos are free and I suggest you check them out.  I'm learning a lot from them.

Check them out here:

He has a "Blog Mastermind" program too where he teaches people how to have more success as a blogger.  If you are interested in that, it's good investment.   You can [read more about it here](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/go/blog_mastermind).
