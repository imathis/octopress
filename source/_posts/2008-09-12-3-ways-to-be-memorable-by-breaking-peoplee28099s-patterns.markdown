I though ya'll might enjoy [this article I wrote for LifeHack.org](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/3-ways-to-be-memorable-by-breaking-peoples-patterns.html#comment-322045) about how to connect with people.



> Life is full of little situations that you encounter regularly.  Some people don’t see these for the opportunities that they are: a chance to stand out, be different, and be memorable.

They’re a way to quickly built rapport with someone so they can think back later and say “Brian…hmm, yeah he was the guy who does [BLANK]” or “Barbara, oh yeah she is the gal who said [BLANK]“.  You stood out enough to be remembered.

By breaking out of your comfort zone and doing something a little different than everyone else you can connect with new people on a regular basis.



The article covers three common social situations that come up and how you can use them to your advantage:



	
  1. What to do when people ask: "How's it going?"

	
  2. Handshakes

	
  3. The two most common small talk questions: "What do you do?" and "Where are you from?"

Until next time, keep breaking free!
