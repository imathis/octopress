Last week we had a U-Haul truck scheduled for Friday afternoon.  After some consideration we decided that we didn't need the truck so I called on Thursday, before the 24-hour limit, and canceled the reservation.  At the time I made the call I was put on hold for several minutes and had a very hurried conversation with the clerk when he came back on the line.

"I need to cancel my reservation."
"What's the name?"
"Nichols"
"Okay, I'll take care of it."

After I hung up I had the feeling that it was all too easy, that he wasn't going to follow through.  In my email to Sibylle that afternoon I remarked that I ought to call U-Haul back to make sure the cancellation was properly completed.  Life being what it is, I never called back.

Last night, while updating our books, Sibylle asked, "What's this $50 charge from U-Haul on Friday for?"  The cancellation had <i>not</i> been properly processed and we had been charge the standard cancellation fee.  I immediately called their 800 number and spoke with a service representative.  She took down all the pertinent information but wasn't really able to do anything for me.  She said that U-Haul Customer Service would call me back within 48 hours.  Since we are on a budget, and a rather tight one at that, the extra $50 makes things even tighter.  Not being able to do anything about it was frustrating.

This morning I called the local U-Haul office and spoke to the clerk and he pulled up the transaction on their computer.  He said he could see where I called and canceled the reservation - they hadn't completed the transaction and therefore I was billed the $50 fee.  He further explained that only the manager can credit an account, that he would pass this information on to him when he arrived around 9:00 am today, and that it would be taken care of then.

I <i>will</i> be calling back to follow through with the manager this morning.
