Today it was warm - nearly 45ยบ and we took advantage of the break from winter to hose out the garage. The car had tracked in a lot of sand and grim from the recent snow, and the garage floor was filthy as a result. With Sibylle manning the hose and me using a large push broom we were able to get most if not all of the gunk out of the garage.

It's funny how little things like cleaning the garage make you feel like a home owner.
