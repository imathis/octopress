In order here are the "meals" I had today.

<strong>Breakfast</strong>
Three-egg folded omelet

<strong>Lunch</strong>
Dublin Coddle (Irish potato and sausage soup)

<strong>Supper</strong>
Chips and salsa
(following a couple of hours of indecision) bowl of Frosted Flakes

The plan tomorrow is to make chili. Or maybe huddle in the corner, rocking back and forth muttering to myself.
