Random thought for the day: for the next version of Apple's operating system, they should really think about synching all your programs, settings, etc across ALL your computers.

Right now I carry a MacBook Pro between home and work every day because maintaining all my programs, files, and settings on two separate machines would simply be far too much work.  Why can't those all be in the cloud?  I'd love to have the raw power and convenience of desktop machines at home and work - but the software underneath would have to all be the same virtualized computer or it would be too much of a hassle.

How many more computers could Apple sell if everyone who currently uses a MacBook as their primary machine went out and bought a desktop or two to complement it?

I wouldn't be surprised if they are already working on this...
