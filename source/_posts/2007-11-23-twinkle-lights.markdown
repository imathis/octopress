On our way to the laundromat to dry a couple of loads of wash, Sibylle pointed out that some of the lights on the Jimmy's dash were behaving weirdly.  The intensity of the lights was flickering, and it looked like one of the gauge lights was trying to come on.

After our drying was completed, and on our way home, all the gauge lights suddenly lit up, and then every light on the Jimmy went off.  Within a second everything was working again, but obviously something was wrong.

In the morning I'll have to take the Jimmy to the dealer and see what's going on and what our options are.
