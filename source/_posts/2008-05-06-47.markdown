As you can see, I was a tiny baby forty-seven years ago.  These images were taken 21 days after my birth, when my weight was back up to a healthy level.  When I was nineteen my mother told me the story of my birth, and the events that followed.  The day I was circumcised I apparently didn't eat much, being somewhat cranky about the procedure.  Each day thereafter I wasn't strong enough to eat enough, and I steadily lost weight.  From a birth-weight of roughly 6 pounds I dropped to 5 pounds.  My mother realizing something was wrong called the doctor on a Friday afternoon.

He was able to give her the last appointment of the day, and immediately had her start feeding me with an eye dropper every 2 hours.  Neither she, nor I, got much sleep, but I did start gaining weight.  By May 28th, when these pictures were taken, I was back up to 6 pounds 8 ounces.
