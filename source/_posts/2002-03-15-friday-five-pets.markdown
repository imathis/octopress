1. What's your favorite animal?
Cats. So free and independent.

2. What pets have you had in your lifetime?
Two cats (current) and a puppy for 3 days.

3. Is there any specific pet that you've wanted but never had? Why?
I've always wanted a bulldog. But I've never felt I had a lifestyle that was good for having a dog.

4. Are you allergic to any animals?
I am sometimes bothered by cat dander, but I love my two felines too much to give them up over a little sneezing.

5. Do you have any 'pet' pet peeves (your pets or others')?
I hate it when people get a dog because they think they are supposed to, and then they ignore the poor thing. Dogs outside at all hours of the day and night, barking at everything that moves. Such a pain.
