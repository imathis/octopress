Somehow I managed to miss seeing <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0164334/" title="Along Came A Spider">Along Came A Spider</a> until now. I remember reading the book and enjoying it, and I found the movie well done too. It had been long enough since I'd read it that the plot twists caught me off guard. All in all a good movie.

Rating: Put it on your Netflix queue.
