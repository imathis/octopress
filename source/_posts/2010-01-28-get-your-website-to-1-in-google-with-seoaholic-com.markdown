**Edit:** Seoaholic has since be re-branded and re-launched as [InboxSeo.com](http://inboxseo.com/?q=1).

This is an exciting announcement.  For the last few months I've been working on a new web app (was contracted to build it actually) and today is the beta launch!

The site is [Seoaholic.com](http://seoaholic.com).  The name is a made up word which combines SEO (search engine optimization) and "work-a-holic".

This is a beta launch so the tool is still a work in progress, but feel free to try it out and send me any feedback on what you like and don't like.

**The main benefit of this tool is to bring more traffic to your website by:**



	
  * Building more incoming links to your site

	
  * Improving your search engine rankings

	
  * Tracking your keyword rankings over time to see big picture SEO changes to your site


As you may know, building incoming links to your website is one of the best ways to improve your search engine rankings.  Seoaholic goes out to find "link opportunities" for you and ranks them by (1) how valuable the link would be if you got it (2) how likely you are to actually get a link from that site.  Seoaholic helps you (and your team) track the process of getting incoming links from those website owners.

A link opportunity is typically a page on a website that is _already linking_ to your competitors or related websites, but they aren't linking to you yet.  It might be a blog post, a list of resources, job posting board, etc.  You have a good chance of getting a link from these pages because they are already linking to sites like yours (by good I mean maybe 25% chance of success instead of 1% like most link building campaigns).  The last step is still up to you: contact the website owner to ask for a link, submit your site (if their site allows it), or write an interesting piece of content they would be likely to link to.  This last step is standard linking building stuff, and remains a manual process (we don't want this to turn into a spamming tool).

The tool manages the rest for you (finding the high value opportunities, checking if they actually linked, managing your team's progress, and seeing how it ultimately affects your rankings).  We imagine it being used by anyone from small time bloggers (who want to improve and track their search engine rankings over time) to hardcore SEO consultants who do this for a living.
