People tell me their business ideas all the time.  They usually want to start a restaurant, or sell something they made, or give their advice as a consultant or coach.

But those businesses don't scale.  The only way people get rich is by developing a product or service that can help a LOT of people, not just a few.

If each person that you help requires **your personal time** then there's only so many you can help, and you probably won't get rich doing it.  (Even if you don't care about getting rich and just want to help people, helping individuals is still an inefficient use of your time, more on this later.)

Sure you can make quite a bit of money in the right job working hourly.  Doctors and lawyers get a high hourly wage.  But they still have to help each person individually which is why they can never be as rich as someone like Bill Gates who has a scaleable business.  His software gets written once, and then distributed to millions of people with very little additional effort for each person who is helped.  Bill Gates makes money from his software while he sleeps, whereas doctors and lawyers still have to keep putting in the hours to get paid.

Scaleable businesses require much more work up front, but once they are off and running they require little or no additional time per person.  That's power because once your business system is in place, your time is still "preserved" for you to work on your next business idea and help even more people.

Compare each of the following.  Which one scales better?




	
  * Giving a speech to a group of people vs. making a recording of that speech to distribute

	
  * Flipping houses vs. building a real estate portfolio over time

	
  * Cooking for a bake sale vs. licensing your recipe

	
  * Your band playing at a local festival vs. selling songs on iTunes

	
  * Talking to customers over the phone vs. taking taking orders through your website

	
  * Accepting checks vs. accepting credit cards

	
  * One-on-one coaching sessions vs. selling a book

	
  * Keeping in touch with friends by email vs. writing to your blog

	
  * Being a freelance programmer for one client vs. selling subscriptions to your software to many clients



Even if you don't care about making money and just want to help people, I'd still argue that you need a system that scales.  You can do the same kind of comparison for non-profit work...

	
  * Volunteering your time at a homeless shelter vs. developing a city wide program to help thousands of homeless

	
  * Feeding a hungry family vs. improving education/changing legislation/etc



It might give you a warm fuzzy feeling to help an individual, but in general I think you're setting the bar too low when you do that and selling yourself short.  Spend your time on something that will really have an impact.

**Making a scaleable business is not easy (otherwise everyone would do it).**

While working hourly, you can see a paycheck in as little as a few days or weeks.  It's dependable.  But while building a scaleable business, you can see zero return for months or years (or maybe never).  All the work is up front.

It's the old linear vs. exponential growth.  That's why most people don't get rich.  They don't want to put the time in up front to see the big payoff down the road.

The next time you have a business idea, try to think about how it will scale and if it could ever really help a TON of people.  If not, is it really worth pursuing?
