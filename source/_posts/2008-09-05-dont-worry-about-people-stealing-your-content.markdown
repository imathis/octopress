> Hi Brian,

I would like to get a marketing opinion of you. I have offered downloadable e-books in the past for other educational products I developed but I had a problem with people stealing the work - buying one e-book, then copying it for others. I even had problems with my printed works in that regard. I had several of my online articles mishandled as well and have since removed every one. It was a bit unsettling since my sellable works were mostly purchase locally and I often knew who was doing it - makes one wonder about people and ethics. What kind of copyright security would I get or should I even worry about it? People seem to steal no matter how many protections one tries to implement. Do you have that problem with your works?

Thanks,
Karen



Hi Karen,

Yes I had the same issue.  Within a few months there were free copies of my book circulating online. But honestly...it didn't bother me one bit. I was just glad people were reading it/using it etc.

The way I look at it, distribution and getting your ideas out there is more important than making money from it. In fact, if you get good distribution the money thing will take care of itself. For every person who reads it free, at least they are exposed to my ideas...then maybe they will benefit from it, and tell other people about it or subscribe to my blog, and end up making me money some other way down the road.

You could get it to 100 people perfectly locked down, get $100 from each, and make $10,000. Or you could get it to a million people, have 90% of them steal it, only get $10 from the remaining people, and still make more that way (a million).

Hope that helps, and until next time, keep breaking free!
Brian Armstrong
