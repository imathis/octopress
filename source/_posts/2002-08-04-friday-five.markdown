1. What is your lineage? Where are your ancestors from? My mother's family is from Ireland and Scotland, while my father's linage goes back to England.

2. Of those countries, which would you most like to visit? All three, but mostly Scotland.

3. Which would you least like to visit? Why? Um, England maybe. No real reason.

4. Do you do anything during the year to celebrate or recognize your heritage? No. My family isn't big on celebrations so I didn't grow up with that in mind. I'm working on it though.

5. Who were the first ancestors to move to your present country (parents, grandparents, etc)? Francis moved here in 1639. Woo-hoo.
