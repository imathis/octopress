After a long time on my current host, I am finally ready to switch to a new host.  I've got nothing against <ahref="http://pair.com" title="Pair.com">Pair.com</a>, except that I can get the same hosting package for far less at any number of other established providers.  If my site were heavily visited I might reconsider my move, but since zanshin.net exists far out on the long tail of the Internet's power curve, i am satisfied to save some money.

There are actually three major facets to this migration:
<ol>
<li>Move <a href="http://andifyoudidknow.com" title="And If You Did Know">andifyoudidknow.com</a> and upgrade it from <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="Wordpress">Wordpress</a> 1.5 to version 2.3.1.</li>
<li>Create a domain for <a href="http://zanshin.net/klaviermusik" title="Elfenbein Klaviermusik">Elfenbein Klaviermusik</a> and transfer its files to the new host.</li>
<li>Convert <a href="http://zanshin.net" title="Zanshin.net">zanshin.net</a> to Wordpress from <a href="http://moveabletype.org" title="MoveableType">MoveableType</a>, and transfer it to the new host.</li>
</ol>

Each of these major pieces breaks down into several smaller steps, which I hope to capture and detail here as I go.  As it is the static of the two domains I already host, I'll be moving And If You Did Know first.

Thanks to Sibylle's research for a web host for a project of hers, I was able to choose a new hosting provider with relatively little effort.  I am going to move to <a href="http://bluehost.com" title="Blue Host">Blue Host</a>.

Over the coming days and weeks I'll be chronicling my progress, and detailing the steps I take here.  Stay tuned, nerdliness ahead.
