[![Entrepreneurship section of DMOZ](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/dmoz1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/dmoz1.png)This is lucky day number 13 of my 30 day challenge to drive more [traffic to this website](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/) and prove that blogging can be profitable!

Notice how I put the link on "traffic to this website" since it includes some better keywords than "30 day challenge".  I'm trying to include more keywords in links.

My three tasks for the day were...

1. I sent Liz a note to see if I could get on her list of [Successful and Outstanding Bloggers](http://successful-blog.com/successful-and-outstanding-bloggers/).  A very creative idea Liz!  And she is spot on that developing relationships with other bloggers seems to be the best way to market you blog.  This has certainly been my experience so far!



2. I started reading Yaro Starak's post on the the 80/20 rule of [search engine marketing for blogs](http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/331/search-engine-marketing-part-1/).  In particular I liked his section on internal links, so I put three internal links at the bottom of each page (in the footer) that include my targeted keywords.  Thanks Yaro!

By the way, Yaro has a [Blog Mastermind group](http://www.blogmastermind.com/) that I'm considering joining.  Yaro earns over $75k per year just from blogging, and I'm sure I could learn a lot from him.

3. Also based on Yaro's blog marketing article, I decided to try submitting my site to the DMOZ directory in the [entrepreneurship](http://dmoz.org/Business/Small_Business/Start_Up/Entrepreneurship/) section.  The DMOZ pages tend to be high page rank.

Finally, I told you I'd report on what happened with the StumbleUpon advertising campaign.

[![Entrepreneurs like this website](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/like1.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/like1.png)Overall it looks like people generally liked the website.  An average of 3.7% of people voted that they liked it, compared to only 0.5% who voted that they didn't.  That means more than 7 times as many people liked it as didn't, and it also means that 96% of people don't vote.

Here are some people who liked it:
[![People who liked the site and might want to know about how to start a business](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/like21-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/like21.png)

[![Generate subscribers and track them with Google analytics](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/stumblesubscribe1-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/06/stumblesubscribe1.png)Unfortunately, the subscriber rate was suite low 0.24% and it generated zero book orders.  Overall I'd say the quality of traffic from StumbleUpon wasn't great, based on this limited test.
