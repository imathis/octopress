[![Adding Meta Tags By Hand (Keyword and description)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/metatragz1-150x150.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/metatragz1.gif)It's day 20 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in [new readers/subscribers/book buyers to this website and demonstrate that blogging can be profitable](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

Here are my three tasks for the day:

1. I've done this not only today, but every day of the challenge: putting [meta keywords and descriptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_tags) into every post by hand.  Brandon wrote in and reminded me of it.

Check out my reply:





> Hi Brandon,

Sure, I'm using a few plugins

Ultimate Tag Warrior (for the meta keywords)
[http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior](http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior)

SEO Title Tag (for the titles):
[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-title-tag/#post-808](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-title-tag/#post-808)

and MetaTagz (for the description):
[http://www.brandonbuttars.com/2007/03/29/wordpress-meta-tags-plugin/](http://www.brandonbuttars.com/2007/03/29/wordpress-meta-tags-plugin/)

Seems like overkill, but I was using something called [All in one SEO](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/)
in the past which didn't do each one quite as well.

Good luck!
Brian



2. I wrote and sent my article on [Why People Hate Cell Phone Companies](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/why-people-hate-cell-phone-companies/) to [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/), because it falls directly in line with his type of thinking.  Hopefully he will get a kick out of it (and may link to it).  Something tells me that this is the type of article that could get picked up on sites like Digg.com and StumbleUpon.com given it's wide appeal.

3. I sent a screen shot to the [37 Signals Blog](http://www.37signals.com/svn/) for their "Screen Around Town" pages.  Interestingly I sent these in the past without any intention of getting back links ([here](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/481-screens-around-town-xbox-sharp-and-r-mail) and [here](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/399-screens-around-town-clickbank-commerce-bank-freshbooks) are examples) because I've always been interested in user interface design.  However, they linked to me as a favor when I sent them the last one, so I've continued to send them.  Getting a link from the Signal vs. Noise blog carries a lot of weight (it is a Google [Page Rank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) 7 site) assuming you get on the home page.

Here is what I sent them:




> Hi Jason,

This dialog in Firefox frustrates me.  I don't know if I typed in the correct login and password, and whether it's worth saving my best guess.

If I tell Firefox to remember it, and I turn out to be wrong (or have made a typo), there is a lengthy process now to track down the incorrect login and password in the security settings and remove it. Otherwise it will bring back my mistake to taunt me every time I see the page.

This could all be solved by showing the dialog one screen later.  Once the next page loads, I'll know if my login was a success or failure, and whether it's worth saving.

P.S. thanks for including my link!  Unexpected perk.




![Firefox Dialog To Remember Passwords](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/firefoxdialog1.png)

They enjoy this type of content for their blog, so I'm just helping them out in exchange for a link.

If you are following along with these steps to apply it to your own website, you probably shouldn't copy this step exactly.  But you can apply the principle.  Go to Technorati and find a [popular blog](http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/) that interests you.  Submit useful links, tips, or tricks to them and you may get a back link (but don't ask for it).
