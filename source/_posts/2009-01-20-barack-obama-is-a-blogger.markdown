[WhiteHouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov/) went through a major transition today during the inauguration.

In a section of the site called "the briefing room" you will now find a [blog](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/) and, perhaps most importantly, a section for a "[weekly video address](http://www.whitehouse.gov/weekly_address/)" by Barack Obama himself.

We've come a long way since Roosevelt's [Fireside Chats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats) and if there was any doubts about the power of blogging, I think they can be put to rest now that even the president has one!

In the age of getting information second hand through media, I think this will be a great tool for transparency in government.

And now after a day full of rhetoric (really, why are we reading poetry and having benedictions when the country is on the verge of bankruptcy?) hopefully Barack can get down to business.
