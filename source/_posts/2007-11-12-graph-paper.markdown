Is there anything is the world as wonderful as a new pad of graph paper?  Fresh smooth pages of quarter inch squares?  Think of the possibilities.  Floor plans, or furniture drawings, geometric doodles, and precision drawings.

Yesterday, while at Wal-Mart, Sibylle remembered that I wanted some graph paper and grabbed a three-pack for us.  With mechanical pencils at the ready we each spent time capturing ideas for spaces in house.  Piano studio, office, kitchen, and dining areas soon graced the opening pages of my tablet.

When I started high school I wanted to be an architect.  It wasn't until my junior year that I discovered computers and switched goals.  A part of me, however, still likes the process of drawing things to scale, capturing ideas with pencil and paper.

Thank you, Sibylle, for the dreams and possibilities contained in the paper, and beyond.
