[![A New About Page - Making A Good First Impression](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/aboutpagew41-150x150.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/aboutpagew41.png)This is day 23 of my 30 day marketing challenge to demonstrate that [blogging can be a profitable and inexpensive business to start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

Today I started reading through Matt Huggins awesome list of [55 essential articles every blogger should read](http://www.matthuggins.com/55-essential-articles-every-serious-blogger-should-read), especially the section on Increasing Traffic & Retaining Readers.

One thing I realized while reading CopyBlogger.com is that they have a great sense of design.  Contrast [this page](http://www.copyblogger.com/five-steps-to-a-truly-unique-blog-that-works/) for example to some of my previous posts.  It's just so clear and readable, and beautiful.  I'm no designer, but one thing I realized is that I need to make subheadings for my 3 points bigger and bolder.  So I'll try that on my post today.

My three marketing tasks for the day were...





### 1. Rewrote the About Page


I was reading [this article on about pages](http://www.copyblogger.com/whats-your-blog-really-about/) and realized that mine could use some work.  It contained lots of info, but wasn't captivating.

I decided to write it more as a story about me (people can't help but listen to stories, it's the most basic form of human communication) that ended with a call to action (subscribe!) and you can check out the [latest version here](http://brianarmstrong.org/about/).

Here is the [old one for comparison](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/old-about/).

Quick poll: do you think it will improve or reduce the % of people who subscribe from that page?  By how much?  I'll post the results in a few days. (Post your answer in the comments.)



### 2. I finished the article for ProBlogger.net


I finished the article from yesterday about the confusion over RSS and sent it to Darren so see if he wants to post it.  I think the article turned out way better having written it, then let it sit for a day, before making the final version.




### 3. Comments



I've been keeping up answering comments on this site.  I'm thrilled to see that we're getting some real discussion.  It let's me know that this experiment is working!



### Other thoughts:


At some point I should probably write a [viral eBook](http://www.copyblogger.com/viral-copy/) which will take a bit longer than one day, but I imagine it would be quite effective.
