Can you imagine if someone made a robot that...



	
  * fell on the floor and hallucinated for 8 hours a day

	
  * constantly needed to be pumped full of dead animals parts and vegetables

	
  * got addicted to various oils and lubricants

	
  * had parts that were impossible to fix or replace

	
  * day dreamed during work about other robots

	
  * got heavier over time

	
  * had about 4 good hours of work in it a day in between checking facebook and youtube videos


We are in trouble as humans I think.  Once machines get smart we'll be obsolete quickly.

The good news?  About the time robots replace us, we'll probably be able to upload our minds right into robot bodies.  Cheerful thought for the day...
