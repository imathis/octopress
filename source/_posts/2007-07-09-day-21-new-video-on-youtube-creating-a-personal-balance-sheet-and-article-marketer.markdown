[![Personal Balance Sheet and Finance](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/813683_accounts_41-150x150.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/813683_accounts_41.jpg)This is day 21 of my 30 day marketing challenge to bring in new readers to this website and demonstrate that blogging can be a [profitable and inexpensive business to start](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/).

I spent the day preparing a personal balance sheet and discussing it with my mentor to track my own wealth building goals.  I'll post on this in more detail shortly.

My three tasks for the day to market this site are as follows:

1. I created a quick video to upload to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) as a marketing tool.  As you know, YouTube gets a ton of traffic and is one of the [top five free ways to market your business](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/the-top-five-ways-to-market-your-business-for-free/).  It was pretty fun to make this video and if it gets some traffic I may make some more.  I have plenty of quick things like that I could teach about finance.

I used [iShowU](http://www.shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html) to record it (for the mac) which was really easy.  If you have a PC you can use something like [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/).

One thing I learned for next time is that I'm going to have to zoom in or make the text bigger, it's not quite as legible as I would have liked.

The video is about how to use excel to answer this question: how much should I save each month to become a millionaire by the time I'm 50?

2. I remembered that I paid for an [Article Marketer](http://www.articlemarketer.com/) account a while back and I haven't been using it as much as I should.  It is a service which will take your articles and make them available in a large number of directories.  People can then find your article and use it as content on their own sites, if they include your link at the bottom.  Essentially, this is a way to syndicate your writing and get links to your website.  I submitted the article on Toastmasters that I wrote for MindPetals and the article on Cell Phone Companies.  I should remember to do this more in the future.

3. I wrote a new article for [LifeHack.org](http://www.lifehack.org) on creating a personal balance sheet to track your net worth.  This is something I discussed with my mentor today.  He made an excellent point that how can you have a net worth goal if you aren't going to measure it?  I may post more about this in the near future.
