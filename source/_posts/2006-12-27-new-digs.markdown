I've started a second weblog, called <a href="http://zanshin.wordpress.com" title="some assembly required">some assembly required</a>. I'm not sure how this site will fit into the "mark nichols online experience" yet. One thought is that I'll save <a href="http://zanshin.net" title="zanshin">zanshin.net</a> for longer, more introspective bits, and use <a href="http://zanshin.wordpress.com" title="some assembly required">some assembly required</a> for shorter, chatty pieces.

Or not.

<a href="http://wordpress.com" title="Wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> offers free weblogs, with world-class software and lots of extras. If you've ever thought about having a weblog but were uncertain as to how to go about it, I highly recommend <a href="http://wordpress.com" title="Wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a>.

One feature I espeically like, and am curious to see in action, is the inclusion of a meebo chat window on the site. Visitors to <a href="http://zanshin.wordpress.com" title="some assembly required">some assembly required</a> will be able to see see if I'm online, and I'll be able to see them (anonymously) as well. We can even chat to each other. Very slick.
