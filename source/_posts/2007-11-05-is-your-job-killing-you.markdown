Ask someone what the three most important things in their life are, and in some order you will probably hear: health, wealth, and relationships.  The later includes friends, family, and lovers.

Is your job helping you improve each of these areas?

**Health**: Chances are your job is the biggest source of stress in your life, could be preventing you from getting enough sleep, and forces you to eat unhealthy food while on the go.

**Wealth**: The story that we've all been told as children (work hard in school, get a good job, work and save for 40 years) is a lie.  More than 80% of Americans end up flat broke in old age, totally dependent on others, and praying that they die before their money runs out.  Having a job is a way to make a living, not build wealth.

**Relationships**: Spending 1/3 of your life at work means you can form great relationships with colleagues (although you rarely get to choose which colleagues you spend time with), but also means your time is limited with the others in your life.

Starting to work for yourself instead of being a slave to your job poses some interesting opportunities:



	
  * A chance to build wealth as a business owner instead of being a wage slave

	
  * Reduced stress, no rush hour traffic, no boss, no annoying colleagues

	
  * The time to exercise regularly, shop for healthy food, and eat without being rushed

	
  * The ability to get enough sleep

	
  * More time with your family, friends, and lovers

	
  * The chance to meet more new people

	
  * An opportunity to work on what you want, instead of what is assigned to you

	
  * As many vacation days as you'd like

	
  * More control over what you do with your time every day of your life!
