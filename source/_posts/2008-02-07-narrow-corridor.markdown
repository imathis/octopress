<a href="http://allaboutvision.com/lenses/progressives.htm" title="All About Vision - Progressives"><img src="http://zanshin.net/images/lens.jpg" alt="progressive lens layout" align="right" height="86" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="215" /></a>As the image to the right shows, the layout of the different focal areas on a progressive lens introduce some interesting geometry into the lenses structure.  In an effort to produce a lens that mimics natural, un-corrected vision, without lines, the optimal corridor of vision can be rather small.  Not to mention the size of the near vision portion at the bottom of the lens.  When I ordered my new lenses we had the lens upsized to the largest lens the frame would support; I cannot believe that I would be able to wear glasses with a smaller progressive lens at all.
