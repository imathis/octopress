If you are part of the enormous collection of states casting votes tomorrow, please exercise your franchise.  The future of America will be decided by those who show up.  If you don't participate then you can't complain about the results.  And if your opportunity is yet to come, please find out all you can about all the candidates, and cast your vote when your turns comes around.
