In the past year my little web site has seen approximately 53,500 visitors. I'm currently averaging about 145 visits per day, or 4,350 per month. Pretty amazing for a site that focuses on my mental state, obscure software, and left leaning politics.

For the the three of you who venture all the way to the bottom of the home page, I have updated the counter there to show what I feel is the lifetime visits for zanshin.net. The traffic to my site has effectively doubled each of the past six years, and I have a fair idea of what my visit total was for the first four years. (Yes, zanshin.net will be ten years old in February 2006. Celebration details will be forthcoming.)

I've crossed the 100,000 visit mark, and should see something like 135,000 in time for the ten year anniversary. <a href="http://woot.com" title="Woot!">W00t</a>!
