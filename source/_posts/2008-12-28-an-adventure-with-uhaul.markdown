We are taking a 14' truck full of boxes, Select Comfort bed pieces, two bicycles, and a variety of other small items to Manhattan KS today.

We were blessed with near 70ยบ temperatures Friday evening when we started loading, but had to contend with freezing temperatures and snow yesterday evening when we finished the process.  Today the forecast is for sunny skies and 45ยบ.

It's going to be a good adventure.
