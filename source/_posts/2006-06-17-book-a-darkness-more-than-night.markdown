I have enjoyed all of Michael Connelly's <i>Harry Bosch</i> novels, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that I had missed a couple along the way. <i><a href="http://www.ereader.com/product/detail/1870?book=A_Darkness_More_Than_Night" title="A Darkness More Than Night">A Darkness More Than Night</a></i> comes at Harry Bosch from the side and gives us a glimpse into the darkness that resides inside of all of us.
