Books that have accurate depictions of martial arts are few and far between. The <i>John Rain</i> series, starting with <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/045120915X/sr=1-1/qid=1150763718/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-2628588-9950523?%5Fencoding=UTF8&s=books" title="Rain Fall">Rain Fall</a></i> by Barry Eisler, is one of only a handful novels with a good story and good martial arts thrown in the mix. I'm re-reading the first four in the series in anticipation of the newly released fifth book.

Rating: As hard hitting as any <i>o-soto-gari</i>.
