BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD

speak with integrity. say only what you mean.
avoid using the word to speak against yourself
or to gossip about others. use the power of your
word in the direction of Truth and Love.


DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY

nothing others do is because of you. what
others say and do is a projection of their own
reality, their own dream. when you are immune
to the opinions and actions of others, you won't
be the victim of needless suffering.


DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS

find the courage to ask questions and to express
what you really want. communicate with others
as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstanding,
sadness, and drama. with just this one agreement
you can transform your life.


ALWAYS BE IN YOUR TRUTH

your truth is going to change from moment to
moment; it will be different when you are
healthy as opposed to sick. under any circumstance,
simply be your truth, and you will avoid
self-judgement, self-abuse, and regret.
