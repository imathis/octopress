Tonight I listened to a new album of Beatles music called <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-Beatles/dp/B000JK8OYU/sr=8-1/qid=1165289012/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-5789284-9266828?ie=UTF8&s=music" title="Love">Love</a></i>. The music on the CD was original the background to a Cirque de Soleil show in Las Vegas, and was put together by George Martin, the Beatles producer. It is an amazing aural experience, especially to someone who was introduced to The Beatles as a child by his mother who loved them too.

I miss you Mom. Thank you for The Beatles and everything else.
