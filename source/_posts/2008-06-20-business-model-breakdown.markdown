Today I've been thinking a lot about different business models for internet companies.  Specifically, internet companies that have some sort of service to match people up.

As you know I've been working on a [new tutoring business model](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/from-new-idea-to-business-launch-in-two-weeks-with-pictures/) lately which is what sparked these thoughts.

Actually there are lots of companies online which match buyers and sellers just like I'm matching tutors and students.

For example, companies like [AutoTrader.com](http://www.autotrader.com) match buyers and sellers of cars.  [Travelocity](http://www.travelocity.com) matches buyers and sellers of airline tickets.  [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com) matches buyers and sellers of all sorts of products.  Even [Match.com](http://www.match.com) matches people (not for buying and selling but for dating).

**Would you believe that each of these companies uses a slightly different business model?**

First of all, WHO do you charge?  Does the buyer pay your fee or the seller?

Secondly, WHEN do you charge?  Do you charge up front to use the service or only after a transaction actually takes place?

I made a little matrix to illustrate these different business models with an example of each.  Here we'll look at WHO gets charged and WHEN in the process:








**Buyer Pays**
**Seller Pays**



**Pay up front**
Match.com
AutoTrader.com



**Pay only when  
transaction takes place**
Travelocity
Ebay



So Match.com's business model is to charge the buyer and they pay up front.  Ebay's business model is to charge the seller and they only pay when an actual transaction takes place.  You get the idea...

Which is best?  I think the answer is that none are better than the other (after all, all four example companies are highly successful).  I think it totally depends on your particular business, and getting in the wrong quadrant could be disastrous if it doesn't fit.

For example, I'd assume its always better to do the "only pay when a transaction occurs" option IF you're able to verify when a transaction actually occurs.  It's much easier to sell this idea to customers "hey I only make money if you make money".  Most people have no problem with that because they can try your service for free and if doesn't work they pay nothing.  That's appealing.  I mean, imagine Ebay charging you up front whether you sold anything or not!  That would be annoying.

But you can quickly imagine why AutoTrader and Match.com can't use this model because they can't verify when a transaction takes places.  No one is going to go buy a car or fall in love without going to LOOK at the product in person first ;)  And once the buyer and seller are in contact outside of your site, what incentive do they have to come back and report to you that a transaction actually took place?  The answer is none.  So AutoTrader and Match.com are forced to charge up front.  A harder sale, but necessary in this case.

Secondly, who should you charge?  Would it make sense on AutoTrader to give free listings to car sellers and charge buyers instead who are searching for cars?  I'm guessing not...the car seller has more to gain by getting a higher price for his or her car so it makes sense to charge them.  If they can sell the car for just $25 more, then they've made up for the cost of posting it on AutoTrader.

**Other Variables**

There are plenty of other options to look at when deciding a business model.  For example, you could just give the product/service [away for free and be advertising supported](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/should-i-charge-for-my-product-or-make-money-off-ads/).  You could also debate between charging a one time fee vs. a monthly subscription.  In general subscription products are more profitable because they come with recurring revenue, but not all products justify it.  Is it something that the customer will need on an ongoing basis (like finding more dates every Friday night on Match.com) or is it a one time need (like selling your car once on AutoTrader).

**So what about tutoring?  A thought exercise...**

For my new business that matches tutors and students online, what is the best business model?

Should the tutor pay to find students or should the students pay to find a tutor?  The tutor stands to make money, but the student is the one in need.  Using the AutoTrader model the tutor would pay, but using the Match.com model the student would pay.

Ideally I'd charge one of them only after a match had been made and they decided to meet.  But I hit the same problem of knowing WHEN a transaction actually takes place...if a tutor and student meet through the website, what incentive do they have to come back and report to me they actually met for 10 hours this month?  Once they have each others email or phone (which is pretty much necessary for deciding you'd like to work with a tutor) they have no need to come back to the website to give me a cut.  So I'm thinking paying up front would be the only option there.

Should it be a one time fee or subscription?  Tutors would probably pay monthly to keep their profile up and get more students to work with, but a student has a need to find a new tutor maybe once or twice a year at most...so that makes more sense as a one time fee I'd think.

Or should it just be a totally free service and make money from ads?

This is all a bit jumbled and just some random thoughts floating around my head today.  But hopefully it helps you see a new way to think about business models and what would work best in any particular situation.

**Lets do a little survey, what do you think would be the best business model for the tutoring business just described and why?  Post in the comments below!**
