In my daily travels around the internet I stumbled across this <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15673" target="_blank">transcript</a> of the speech given by actor Tim Robbins to the National Press Club on April 15, 2003. Because of his position on the war in Iraq, and because of his wife, Susan  Sarandon's, position on the war, his scheduled appearance at the Baseball Hall of fame was cancelled by its director.

I think it perfectly sums up the dangerous situation we have in this country today. As Mr. Robbins says in his speech, "In this time when a citizenry applauds the liberation of a country as it lives in fear of its own freedom, when an administration official releases an attack ad questioning the patriotism of a legless Vietnam veteran running for Congress, when people all over the country fear reprisal if they use their right to free speech, it is time to get angry."
