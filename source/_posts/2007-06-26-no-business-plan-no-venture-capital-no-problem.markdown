Here is a great video that was posted on Guy Kawasaki's blog which reinforces my main message:



	
  * I don't believe in business plans

	
  * You probably don't need venture capital

	
  * Just get started with something, and grow from there

        
  * If it doesn't work out, you've lost nothing, and learned a valuable lesson

        
  * Your next try will be that much more likely to succeed



It's a discussion panel with 5 entrepreneurs who bootstrapped.




> Markus Frind, the founder of PlentyOfFish.com is my new hero (James Hong of Hot or Not is a close second). Marcus spends about two hours a day in his underwear managing a free dating website that gets twelve billion page views a year. He is the only employee, and he only has one server. And by the way, he makes $5-6 million/year with Google ads.
