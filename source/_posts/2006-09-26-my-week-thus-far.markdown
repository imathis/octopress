My flight home from Portland, via Houston, was rain delay a couple of hours so I arrived at 1:00 am instead of 11:00. After collecting baggage and driving home it was after 2:00 before I was back in the apartment.

Later on Sunday, deciding to trim my beard I grabbed the trimmer and commenced "trimming." There seemed to be an unusual amount of hair being cut off. In fact there was a LOT of hair being trimmed. Seems that when the trimmer was knocked on the floor the week before my trip the depth setting was reset to "2" from its normal "6" or "7".

It'll grow back.

On Monday after getting home from work Nekko wasn't herself. On Sunday it appeared that she was limping a little, and she seemed a bit subdued. After some deliberation I took her to the animal hospital. She is diabetic. Her condition is moderately severe due to ketone buildup and she will need to be hospitalized until at least Thursday before she stabilizes. At $4-600 per day cost to me.

Once she's stable and I can bring her home I'll have to learn how to inject her with insulin twice a day for the rest of her life. I'll also become a frequent visitor to the vet as they will need to be involved in her treatment on an ongoing basis.

This is a cat who dislikes being held and hates being picked up.

Today I learned that she also has a heart condition that causes the muscle to thicken, reducing it's effectiveness. So it works harder, thus making it thicker again. This can be controlled with medication, but that means getting my cat to swallow a pill once a day for the rest of her life.

I figure the car is going to explode tomorrow.
