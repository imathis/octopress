<p>Seeing a fan-made commercial for the iPhone based on Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, I had to add it to my site. When I previewed the new posting the random title picker embedded in my site happen to chose the 2001 line, "My God! It's full of stars." as the title. The synchronicity was too great to pass up and hence this screen capture.</p>
