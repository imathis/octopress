I'm permanently 72 cubic MM smaller today.  Maybe 73.

As a follow-up to my physical last month I had a dermatology visit yesterday to have some moles on my back examined.  There is a history of melanoma in my family, and one or two of the spots on my back were suspicious enough that my primary physician wanted the dermatologist to have a look.  The appointment was one of the speedier doctor visits I've ever had; thirty minutes from start to finish, including 4 stitches.

There were two spots he wanted to remove, one 4x4 MM and the other 4x5 MM.  The whole process took about 5 minutes, and now I've got two dents in my back, each roughly 2 MM deep.  The stitches are to stay in for 10 days, which seems like a great long time given the size of the wounds.  No shower for the first 24 hours, so I'm all itchy this morning.  The spots are a bit itchy, but not really painful.

When I go back in 10 days to have the stitches removed I'll get the pathology results.  As he was leaving the treatment room the doctor said that he didn't think these were anything to lose sleep over.
