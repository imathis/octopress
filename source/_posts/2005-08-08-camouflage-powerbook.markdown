Increasingly on television I am seeing <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/" title="Apple Powerbooks">Apple Powerbooks</a> prominently displayed and yet camouflaged at the same time. Just this evening I watched <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/xtremehome/index.html" title="Extreme Makeover: Home Edition">Extreme Makeover: Home Edition</a> where the crew was "watching" a video on an 15" Aluminum Powerbook; only the Apple logo on the lid was covered by a wide piece of tape stretched from edge to edge horizontally.

<a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/index.html" title="The West Wing">The West Wing</a> is another show that frequently places Powerbooks in full view of the camera, only their emblems are covered.

What gives?

Any one who has ever seen a Powerbook up close will instantly recognize it for what it is, regardless of air brushing the frames, or applying a "White House" sticker over the glowing Apple in the lid.

I guess the television producers don't want to give free advertising to merchants who aren't paying for the privilege. Corporate America doesn't make much sense some times.
