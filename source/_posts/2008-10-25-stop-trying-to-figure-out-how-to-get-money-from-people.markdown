Instead, start asking how you can create **value**.

Most people get it backwards.  They come up with a way to make money first, and then try to add the value in as an afterthought.

**Do you see why this is putting the cart before the horse:**



	
  * I want to sell subscriptions to the "premium" content of my website.  What do you think people would be willing to pay for?

	
  * I'd like to write a book.  What would be a marketable topic that people are interested in these days?

	
  * We need to sell the next version of our operating system (*cough* vista *cough*).  What features can we add in there so people will think it's worth it?



When you think about making money first, it corrupts your ability to make the most valuable product because you've already decided your course of action.  You never stop the ask, "is this even the best way to help people?"


One of the reasons I think Google is so successful is that, believe it or not, they don't focus on making money.  The most surprising thing I saw when I visited Google a few years back is that if you want to get approval to work on a new product there, you will NEVER be asked "how is this going to make money?"  They really don't care because they know if it actually does help people do something faster, easier, or in a less painful way then it will become popular.  And there are numerous ways to monetize a popular product.

In fact, I was surprised that they even called them "products" because they had no plans to make money with them up front ("projects" probably would have been a better name).

Do you think that ever happens at traditional companies like GE, Ford, and Microsoft?  Hell no.  They are doing tons of market research, feasibility studies, price point analysis, and net present values to see if a product can make money.

The irony of it is that if you get the first part right and actually do create something that is valuable, the money part will take care of itself.
