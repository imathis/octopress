Sibylle and I had a quiet weekend.  Saturday was spent doing very little; we slept in late and then took a nap in the afternoon.  The most ambitious thing we accomplished all day was making dinner and sitting down to watch <i>The Full Monty</i> while we ate.

Sunday was also laid back, although we did venture out to run some errands and to try a new Mongolian BBQ restaurant - <a href="http://www.huhot.com" title="HuHot Mongolian Grill">HuHot Mongolian Grill</a>.  We both enjoyed the fare, and the chance to eat out.  We did some window shopping afterwards and  eventually bought groceries for the week before coming home.

After the hectic weeks of moving this summer, and then our trip to Germany, it was very nice to have an unstructured, unplanned, no-expectations weekend to just <i>be</i>.
