I've seen the story below repeated in a few places now: amazing violinist plays in a subway station - nobody notices.

People draw all sorts of inspiring conclusions from it (and apparently it has brought some people to tears).

I think they are missing the point.  To me it just shows:



	
  1. Most people don't care about classical music

	
  2. Many who do like the _idea_ of it (dressing up, feeling sophisticated, saying smart things to their friends) perhaps more than the music itself


There are a lot of similarities to classical music and expensive wine.  Many people probably can't tell the difference between a $100 and $20 bottle of wine, but they still like the _idea_ of drinking a $100 bottle of wine - the main benefit of consuming it is not the wine itself.

Or in psychology terms, we overly rely on price as an indicator of quality.

Related note: A Snickers bar tastes better than 99% of See's candy, is 1/10th the cost, and doesn't require you to play Russian Roulette with your taste buds.
