This is the 500th posting to zanshin.net since I started using the domain as a blog in late 1999. Originally a place to try and attract people to read my thoughts, this weblog has grown into an essential part of my self-maintenance routine. Whenever I need to understand a thought or emotion at a deeper level I put it into words, and those words find a home here. Knowing that anyone with Internet access can read them is nice, but for me the real importance of posting here is the feeling of permanence that is added by putting my inner self down into words. The mechanical process of typing coupled with the mental process of organizing my thoughts has more than once led me to new understand of myself.

Not bad for a medium that largely smoke and mirrors.
