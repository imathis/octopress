One of the technical books in my current reading rotation is <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596008740/sr=8-1/qid=1140571066/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6736304-3080716?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="Prefactoring: Extreme Abstraction - Extreme Separation - Extreme Readability">Prefactoring: Extreme Abstraction - Extreme Separation - Extreme Readability</a></i> by Ken Pugh. Whereas refactoring pertains to improving code, Prefactoring deals with bettering design. I've always been fascinated by the processes that develop in and around software development, formal or informal, and this book is giving me new insights about the process of design.

Rating: Required reading if you use the words software and design in a sentience
