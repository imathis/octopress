We are planning a trip to Tampa for Christmas. Michele lived there for a number of years and hasn't been back since she left over 5 years ago. He brother is moving back there and we think we can talk her mom in to flying down there to join us. The trick with this trip isn't the distance or cost. It's the flying. As much as I hate to admit it OBL and his band of terrorists have altered the way I look at travel. Our fears about flying are minimal and yet they are there. Added to that is the knowledge that even safe flights are going to be very stressful thanks to the increased security measures. Our world has truly changed forever. How very sad.
