Easily one of my favorite books, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380973464/sr=8-3/qid=1149946791/ref=pd_bbs_3/103-8820890-2075017?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a></i> combines World War II cryptography with nerdy dotcom era technology in a globe spanning tale that is just as good the second (or third) time you read it, as it was the first.

Rating: One of my five all-time favorite books.
