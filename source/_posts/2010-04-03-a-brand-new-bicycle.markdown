Today I purchased a brand new bicycle for myself. Earlier in the week we had gotten one for Sibylle. Rather than cross post from our site to this one, go ahead and click through to read about <a title="Bicycles Built for Us" href="http://sibylleandmark.wordpress.com/2010/04/03/on-a-bicycle-built-for-us/" target="_blank">bicycles built for us</a>. In the meantime, here's a picture of my new bike.
