Ever since switching over to Macintosh last January I have thoroughly enjoyed using Safari as my primary browser. My only complaint is Safari's inability to view PDF files inline.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.schubert-it.com/" title="Schubert it">Schubert it</a> and the <a href="http://www.schubert-it.com/pluginpdf/" title="PDF Browser">PDF Browser</a> that complaint is now happily removed.

This browser plugin makes viewing PDF files served on the Internet easy once again.
