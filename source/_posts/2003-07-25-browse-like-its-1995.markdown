In a trend that oddly mirrors the recent <a href="http://texturadesign.com/html/index_previous.htm#072403">flap</a> over <a href="http://www.buy.com">buy.com</a>'s new <a href="http://buymusic.com/">music</a> service, my <a href="http://www.sharebuilder.com">sharebuilder</a> account was inaccessible to me this afternoon.

It seems that the powers that be at Sharebuilder think I should be using a browser newer than Microsoft or Netscape 4.0. Hmm, I thought Safari, Camino, and Mozilla Firebird <i>were</i> all newer than 4.0.

Lucky for me, Safari can mask itself as other user agents. A quick trip to the Debug menu and I was able to login again.
