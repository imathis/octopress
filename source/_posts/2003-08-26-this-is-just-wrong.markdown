<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/26/international/worldspecial/26CND-IRAQ.html?ex=1062561600&amp;en=8050326054a8bf0f&amp;ei=5062&amp;partner=GOOGLE">This</a> article says it all. As of today more American servicemen and service women have been killed since the war "ended" on May 1st, than were killed during the official war.

My heart goes out to every family who has members in harm's way. Your debt is one our society is ill-equipped to ever repay.
