I put [this website](http://mybestpic.org) together over the last few weeks that I thought you might like.

It's quite simple.  Basically you can hold a "photo contest" and see which photo your friends like best.

Here are a few examples...

1. Choose a photo of yourself.

2. Choose artwork or travel photos.

3. For downright silliness.

I'll do a follow up post in a week or so with more details on the idea and results of the site.  But for now...


# [Try it out](http://mybestpic.org) and let me know what you think!
