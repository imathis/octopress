If you don't know who Gary Vaynerchuk is.  He runs the very successful [Wine Library TV](http://tv.winelibrary.com/) which gets something like 85,000 readers per day.

He is one of the rare bloggers who has managed to get on/in the Wall St. Journal, GQ, Time, Conan, Ellen, etc.

His style is irreverent and he isn't afraid to tell it like it is.

Here are two talks he has given about how important it is to build brand equity.  Brand equity is how well you are recognized in people's minds.  Yes YOU can and should be a brand.

Brand equity can weather any recession, can launch any company, and can open doors for you around the world.

The beautiful part about technology (the internet, videos online, blogging, etc.) is that it has leveled the playing field.  You no longer need to live in LA or New York to get discovered.  You no longer need a huge marketing budget.  You no longer need contact in mainstream media (tv, radio, print, etc).  Now ANYONE with talent than can rise to the top regardless of where you start.

Check out these two inspiring videos from Gary, and get to work today on building YOUR brand equity:

On another note.  I really need to start going to some of these conferences.  It's amazing what getting around liked minded people can do to help propel you to the next level.

Until next time, keep breaking free!
