Ever since getting my first Palm Pilot many years ago, I have been a big fan of electronic books.  First with Peanut Press, and now with eReader, I have collected nearly 400 electronic books.  The diminutive screen size has never bothered me, and I have enjoyed the portability and availability of having one, or two, or twelve, books in my pocket.

I was quite pleased to discover that the folks at eReader have ported their reader application to the iPhone and iPod touch through the new Application Store.  The embedded video below demos the features on a new iPhone.

I am looking forward to the day when I can have one of these wonders in my pocket.
