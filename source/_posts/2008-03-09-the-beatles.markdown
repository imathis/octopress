Having grown up listening to The Beatles I am hugely pleased by the "<a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/03/09/mccartney-reportedly-inks-deal-with-apple" title="McCartney reportedly inks deal with Apple">McCartney reported inks deal with Apple</a>" headline over at Ars Technica.  No time frame yet of when the catalog will appear on iTunes, but I would suspect this will make a great "one more thing" bit at this years WWDC.
