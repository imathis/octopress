[![Blog Rush Tool To Generate Traffic To Your Blog](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/09/blogrush3454t1-150x150.png)](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/blogrush/)You might have noticed a new widget I added to the blog which looks like this:

This is a great little tool developed by internet marketing guru John Reese who I've talked about before.  When I first read about it I thought it sounded pretty simple and ineffective, but it's actually more powerful than I originally thought.

What it does it post related articles from other blogs around the internet on to your site, and likewise your articles start appearing on other blogs who use the widget.  But the beauty of it is that it contains a "referral system" which will really help it go viral.  Essentially, whenever someone clicks the widget on your site to add their own blog to the system, you earn a referral credit.  This actually goes 10 levels deep...meaning that the people you refer count toward yours, etc.  And the more referral credits you have the more likely your articles are to appear.

Anyway, you can watch a great little video about how it works and see it action by going here: [http://www.startbreakingfree.com/blogrush/](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/blogrush/).

It takes a few minutes to install on your blog, so get in as early as you can.

The program is called BlogRush...and I think it will really shake things up in the blogging world.  Check it out now: [http://www.startbreakingfree.com/blogrush/](http://www.startbreakingfree.com/blogrush/)
