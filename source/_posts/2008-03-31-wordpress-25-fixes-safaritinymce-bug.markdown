Ever since switching my site's back end over to Wordpress in late December I've had to use Camino or Firefox to edit or produce new postings to my site, as there was a <a title="Safari, Wordpress, and TinyMCE" href="http://zanshin.net/2008/01/25/safari-wordpress-and-tinymce/" target="_blank">bug in the TinyMCE implementation</a> that Wordpress was using.  Any entry edited via Safari had all of its &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tags stripped out leaving the posting as one large, uninterrupted block of text.

I am happy to report that, having upgraded to Wordpress 2.5, I am able to use Safari to post and edit entries on my site.  The formatting works.  I don't have anything against Camino or Firefox, but Safari is my primary browser on OS X, and I am much happier now that I can do all my web related activities inside of one browser.
