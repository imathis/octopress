Tuesday's windshield repair seemed to go smoothly at the time. The glass is fine, but the rain sensor promptly fell off it's mounting point and is now dangling behind the inside rear-view mirror. When I discovered this on the way home yesterday I called the installer and scheduled a second repair for today.

The first repair was "scheduled" to happen between 8:00 am and 12:00 pm. Naturally the installer showed up precisely at 12:00. So when I was told that the new appointment could be today between 1:00 and 5:00 I explained that I'd be leaving work at 3:00 so that car's location would change after that time. The dispatcher then wanted to schedule a range that ended at 3:00; recalling the result of that on Tuesday, I said it had to be <b>completed</b> no later than three.

So now I have a "scheduled" visit between 8:00 am and 2:00 pm.

Why can't they just say, "You're number <i>x</i> on a list of <i>y</i> customers, and the typical service call lasts 45 minutes, so we'll call you around (<i>x</i> times 45 minutes after 8:00) to let you know the exact time."

Obviously, since the time spans the lunch hour, they will call just after I get my meal heated up and back to my desk -- regardless of the time I decide to eat.

Sigh.
