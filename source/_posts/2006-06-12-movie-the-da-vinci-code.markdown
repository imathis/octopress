<i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0382625/" title="The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a></i> was a fantastic book and, while well acted, is only a good movie. The story is too cerebral for American audiences who want explosions and sex rather than murky, esoteric dialog about what is or isn't true of the history of Christianity. Still, it was as faithful a rendition of the book as you are apt to find.

Rating: How symbolic that the furor before its release was greater than the actual impact
