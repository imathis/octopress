[![Business Card Breaking Free](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/front1-150x150.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oldbloguploads/2007/07/front1.gif)This is day 17 of my 30 day marketing challenge to demonstrate blogging can be a [profitable and inexpensive business](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/website-marketing-three-tasks-per-day-for-a-month/) to start.

My three tasks for today were:

1. I spent the morning getting the audio recording of the [author interview](http://brianarmstrong.org/posts/day-16-engaging-readers-in-conversation-interview-on-calling-all-authors-and-a-research-tip-from-john-reese/) put on the website.  This will be a great way for people get an overview of the website and my philosophy on starting a business in an audio format, and will make the site more sticky.  Check for it a little bit later today.



2. I spoke with 1and1 and they finally transfered this site to a new shared server.  I've noticed it loading much faster.

3. I created some business cards for this website in Photoshop, and ordered them through [48HourPrint.com](http://www.48hourprint.com).  It cost me $66.92 (including shipping) for 500 cards. (see photo)
