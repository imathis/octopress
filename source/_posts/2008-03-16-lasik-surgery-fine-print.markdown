The March 13th online edition of the New York Times has an article looking at the 5 - 10% of people who elect to have Lasik surgery and discover that it isn't always a panacea.  As one who had the surgery and is now ruing the day I ever considered it for myself, I strongly recommend that anyone considering this surgery read this article and then have a long talk with your regular eye professional.  Unless glasses are somehow injurious to you then I would suggest you not have the surgery.  Not wearing glasses is not a good enough reason.

My reason was wanting to eliminate the bifocal portion of my vision, to be able to see objects up close and far away without correction.  Unfortunately my eyes did not respond to the treatment and I am wearing glasses again, less than two years later.

Please, if you are thinking about Lasik, go <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/fashion/13SKIN.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=4656a9e8333fdb16&amp;ex=1206072000&amp;emc=eta1" title="Lasik Surgery: When the Fine Print Applies to You">read this article</a>.
