The <a href="http://www.afa.net" title="American Family Association">American Family Association</a> has an <a href="http://www.afa.net/petitions/marriagepoll.asp" title="AFA Homosexual Marriage Poll">online pole gauging the support of people for homosexual marriage or civil union</a>. Since the AFA is a conservative organization I think it's safe to assume that they were hoping for a ground swell of opposition to the idea. They claim the results will be submitted to Congress, but given that as of today (12.22) the results are nearly 2 to 1 in favor of homosexual marriage I have to wonder if they'll honor this claim.
