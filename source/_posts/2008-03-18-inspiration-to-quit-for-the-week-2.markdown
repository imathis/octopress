Here are some links to various articles I've found interesting in the past week...

[The Inner Game Of Starting Your Own Business](http://how2livelife.blogspot.com/2008/03/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-being.html)



> Entrepreneurship is very, very, very emotional. The emotional rollercoaster is such a substantial part of the entrepreneurship. I haven't seen any entrepreneurship textbooks address this extremely important issue. If you’re doing anything you’re actually passionate about, this is a necessary requirement. You have really high highs, and really low lows.



[Seth Godin on Persistence](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/03/persistence.html)


> Persistence isn't using the same tactics over and over. That's just annoying.

Persistence is having the same goal over and over.



[Eben Pagen on How Small Changes In A Name Can Make All The Difference](http://www.gurumastermind.com/media/The_Marketing_Voodoo_Report.pdf)



> Answer this question, FAST:
Which of these two book titles sells more copies…

Book #1: “A Thinking Person's Step by Step Guide to Weight Loss & Exercise Program”

Book #2: “Skinny Bitch”

A Thinking Person's Step by Step Guide to Weight Loss & Exercise Program
was written by two Ph.D.s and based on empirical research by guys with doctorate
degrees.

Skinny Bitch was written by an ex-model and an ex-modeling-agent (if that’s
how you say it).

Time’s up. Which one sells more?

Well, according to Amazon.com, A Thinking Person's Step by Step Guide to
Weight Loss & Exercise Program is their #437,317th best-selling book, whereas
Skinny Bitch comes in at #56.

My question for you is…

WHY? 



[Amazing People Don't Have (Or Need) Resumes](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/03/why-bother-havi.html)




> How about three extraordinary letters of recommendation from people the employer knows or respects?
Or a sophisticated project they can see or touch?
Or a reputation that precedes you?
Or a blog that is so compelling and insightful that they have no choice but to follow up?

Some say, "well, that's fine, but I don't have those."

Yeah, that's my point. If you don't have those, why do you think you are  remarkable, amazing or just plain spectacular?
