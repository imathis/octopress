I did a great interview with Gordie Rogers recently about BuyersVote.com.

I think it turned out really well, and you can read the [full post here](http://lifestyledesign4u.com/2009/07/interview-brian-armstrong-talks-about-his-newly-launched-buyersvote-com/).

It really helped me clarify my own ideas to write some of them down.

Here's an excerpt:


> I think the biggest challenge for BuyersVote moving forward will be reaching critical mass. There is a definite network effect where the more votes you have, the more people want to vote and the more valuable the site is. So the biggest challenge will be getting those early adopters who really believe in the idea and are willing to participate before it’s huge. I think the central idea of the site, which is that the content is 100% controlled by you and that the site will always be 100% free, will help contribute to this. There is also a huge “make the world a better place” potential to this project which I think is enticing. Scams and bad companies can be eliminated, people will get more value for their money, etc. It’s basically a free and more useful version of Consumer Reports and the Better Business Bureau. To me these are important ideals, and hopefully others will see the potential in it as well.
