# Background

Last December I found myself setting off for a month-or-so-long sojourn of Western Europe, and visited some amazing cities over the course of the following 5 weeks. I spent time in the beautiful cities of London, Paris, Barcelona, Venice, Prague and Berlin, among others.

When I returned home I found myself faced with a not-so-unfamiliar dilemma: after whittling down my photos to a list of just over 100, how do I incrementally upload them to Flickr? It was the same problem I faced after processing photos from a model shoot or a photowalk.

# Solution

This time, though, I was determined to automate my problem away. This time, I spent a day or two working on a very basic version of an online application that would allow me to upload all of my photos, which would then "trickle" my photos into Flickr at the rate of one photo per day.

The result was Picdrip, which lives at http://picdrip.com in its largely unpolished state.
