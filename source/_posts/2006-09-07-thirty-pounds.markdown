I have passed the thirty pounds lost milestone. To celebrate I went out this past weekend and bought new pants for work. The current set are not only starting to show their age, they are baggy enough to draw comments from friends at work. On several occasions now I have seen people who haven't seen me since I started my weight loss and they have all commented on the change in my appearance. It feels very good to have the weight loss recognized by others.

So far I've been averaging about ten pounds of loss per month. Provided this rate of loss keeps up I should see my initial goal of two hundred pounds by Halloween, and be in the one-ninety range for Christmas. That would be amazing.
