This posting is being created entirely from my desktop. Using the brand new software goodie from <a href="http://ranchero.com/" title="Ranchero">Ranchero</a>, <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/" title="MarsEdit">MarsEdit</a> I can develop postings from my computer using a Mail.app like interface and upload them to zanshin via an XML remote procedure call interface. How utterly cool is this?
