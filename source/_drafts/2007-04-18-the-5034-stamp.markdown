So, as it turns out, you can't use scotch tape to fix a stamp to an envelope.

A while back I made a purchase that came with one of those handy mail-in rebates.  Naturally I forgot about it until the night before it had to be post-marked.   I carefully filled out all the paperwork and put it into the envelope, sealed it, and put my last stamp on it.  Ready to be mailed in the morning.

Then I discovered I had left out the sales slip.

Phooey.

Putting <i>all</i> the stuff in a new envelope I was faced with the lack of a stamp.  Enter the scotch tape.  What could be better?  Two little pieces and away we go.

Today, now several days past the post-mark deadline, the envelope came back. Marked, "Stamps are void when coated, defaced, or re-&lt;smear of red ink here&gt;. Returned for postage."

Whoops.

So, as it turns out, I'm out the $0.39 stamp and the $49.95 rebate.  How many people can say they have an unused (but "coated") thirty-nine cent stamp in their collection that is worth $50.34?
