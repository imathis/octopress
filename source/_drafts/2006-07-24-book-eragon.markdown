<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375826696/sr=8-3/qid=1153791961/ref=pd_bbs_3/104-8769076-5479133?ie=UTF8" title="Eragon">Eragon</a></i> isn't the best debut novel I've ever read, but it is certainly very good. Unfortunately it is a trilogy in progress; only the first two volumes have been published. I can start book two right away, but it appears I may have to wait a year or more to finish the tale.

Rating: Wait for book three and then read it all at once.
