It has been just over four weeks since I had LASIK surgery to my eyes. The changes, while immediately apparent, are still not what I had hoped for. When the literature says your vision may not stabilize for six months they really aren't kidding.

<strong>Halos</strong>
The halos around lights at night have diminished to a tolerable level. Whereas the first couple of weeks I had to wear sunglasses even at night to cut the effect now I notice, but am not really bothered by, the halo effect. Recently while looking up at a starry sky I discovered that the halos aren't full circles any more, they only exist on the nose side of each eye. More of a crescent than a halo. I take this as a sign that the incision continues to heal, and I hope that means there is more improvement in my overall vision on the way.

<strong>Far Vision</strong>
For the most part I am able to see distances satisfactorily. The sharp focus I expected isn't there, but I can read road signs and generally exist in the world. What is disconcerting is when my brain decides to use the near eye in a distance situation. Driving, particularly when the windshield is covered with bugs, my brain wants to focus on the bugs and not the road ahead. Most of my daily computer usage seems to be through the far eye, which I did not expect. It isn't able to clearly focus on the screen, but I can see well enough to get along. I also notice a delay in being able to see clearly when switching from reading or using the computer to walking or driving. My brain is slow to change eyes at times which is annoying.

<strong>Near Vision</strong>
Up to a distance of about nine or ten inches I can see with great focus with my near eye. Once in a while it seems like that range increases briefly, only to return to the hand span distance I've had since right after the surgery. Peering out of the top of my eye (like you would do to look over a pair of glasses) I can see farther with the near eye; again making me suspect that the incision is still interfering with clear vision straight ahead. Earlier in the day I can see better with this eye, but as the day progresses my vision deteriorates.

<strong>Overall</strong>
On the whole I have very mixed feelings about this experience. If in five or six more months I can see as I expected to as a result of the procedures I'll be very pleased, and will likely owe the doctors and staff at LASIK<em>Plus</em> an apology. At tomorrow's check up I think they are going to get an earful of frustration and fear. The single thing I wanted to be able to do without glasses was use the computer, and that is still the single thing I can't do today.

Would I recommend this to other people? Not yet. Until they tell me that my eyes are fully healed and that my vision is where it will be as a result of the surgery, I can't know whether this was a good decision or not. Right now I'm trapped in limbo, not knowing if I made the biggest mistake of my life or bought myself years of glasses free living.
