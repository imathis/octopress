In addition to great customer service, and fantastically fast shipping, <a title="Zappos" href="http://zappos.com">Zappos</a>, it seems, has a sense of humor.

I've been wearing my new Timberland shoes indoors only since they are a little tighter than I'd like, and I want to be able to exchange them for the next size larger if necessary. Consequently I swap them with my old shoes at the start and end of each day, and before and after lunch. Toward that end I <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com">twittered</a> this <a title="A tweet from August 13th" href="http://twitter.com/zanshin/status/3294578655">yesterday afternoon</a>:
<blockquote>Test driving a pair of shoes from #Zappos. Makes be feel like Mr. Rogers. Changing shoes at the beginning and ending of every show. Er, day.</blockquote>
Zappos responded with a twitter of their own a <a title="A tweet from Zappos" href="http://twitter.com/Zappos_Service/status/3295102868">short time later</a>:
<blockquote>@Zanshin Do you have your sweater?</blockquote>
With so many retweet bots adding noise to the twitter stream these days, it was wonderful to see that Zappos has an actual human reading and responding to Zappos tagged tweets.
