There's a construction crew making good use of today's near 60º temperature working up the street. They are putting the stone facade on a new house four houses up the street from us. Call it five houses distance as there is an intervening street too. Like all construction crews they have a large, loud stereo going.

How loud?

Loud enough to hear, or rather feel, the incessant thump of the bass from the rap-crap they are listening to.

I will be so very glad when all the houses in this neighborhood are completed an the noise, chaos, large beeping vehicles, and mess are gone. In other words, "Get off my lawn."

<strong>Updated</strong>: A call to the Riley County Police department has been made. They were courteous and helpful. A squad car is being sent to deal with the matter.
