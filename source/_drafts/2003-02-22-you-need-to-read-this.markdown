Anita Ramasastry, a professor from the University of Washington School of Law, has  a commentary on the Domestic Security Enhancement Act (aka Patriot II), <a href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/ramasastry/20030217.html" target="_blank">Patriot II: The Sequel Why It's Even Scarier than the First Patriot Act.</a> There are a lot of scary things highlighted in this article, too many to even know which to select as an excerpt. But do note two things: this document wasn't publicly released, it was leaked, and apparently Congress has played little to no part in its drafting.
