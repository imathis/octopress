Today is the anniversary of the day I asked Michele to marry me. That she said yes filled me with joy and happiness. I was proud to be her husband and honored to be her friend. Today I have mixed feelings, but mostly I am having good memories. I've written more about it on her site, <a href="http://andifyoudidknow.com" title="And If You Did Know?">andifyoudidknow.com</a>.
