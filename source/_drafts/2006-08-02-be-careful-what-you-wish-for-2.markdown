Every once in a while you take a course of action thinking that it will lead you in one direction, while secretly hoping that a desire you can't even voice will actually come true. Joining eHarmony was just such an event for me. I thought it would lead to meeting some new people, that it would be a good way to dip my toe back into the pool, as it were. Secretly I was hoping that I'd meet someone special, someone that I would really like. Someone who would like me back.

Imagine how wonderful it would be to meet someone who thinks like you, expresses themselves openly and honestly, who responds to you, and to whom you respond, and for whom you have strong feelings after just a short time.

Imagine how absolutely freaking scary it would be to meet someone who thinks like you, expresses themselves openly and honestly, who responds to you, and to whom you respond, and for whom you have strong feelings after just a short time.

Just imagine.
