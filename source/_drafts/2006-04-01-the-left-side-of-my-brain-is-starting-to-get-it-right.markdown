Everyday for the past nine days I have started the morning my covering first one eye and then the other to see what I could see. Everyday for the past eight days when I put my hand over my left eye what I see with my right has been blurry and out of focus beyond a range of eight or so inches.

Today when I tried my highly scientific little eye test I could actually read the computer screen at nearly arms length - <em>with either eye</em>. The text still isn't sharp but it is a lot better than it was yesterday morning. My theory is that my eyes are going to be there best first thing in day as they've been relaxed and unused all night. In other words, I'm not going to be surprised if this new found focal distance fade a bit during the day as my eye gets tired.

Still is is <strong>hugely</strong> encouraging to see the text on the screen as well with my right (near) eye as with my left (far) eye. I think a celebratory breakfast at the local greasy spoon is in order. Hot-diggity.
