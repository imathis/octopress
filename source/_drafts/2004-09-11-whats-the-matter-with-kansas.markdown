Michele and I just finished reading "What's The Matter With Kansas?" by Thomas Frank. The subtitle of the book is "How Conservatives Won The Heart Of America." It is a fascinating look at the radical shift towards the right that is happening in America today. Using Kansas, and the century or more of Populist movement that originated in here in the 1890s, Frank paints a clear, concise picture of how the radical right is is using polarizing issues to leverage the very people they are hurting the most.

For the first time I understand that the new conservatives, the neo-cons, eliminate economy from their arguments, that their entire house of cards is built on the idea of victimization and attacks from the liberal left. I cannot begin to do justice to his arguments. Mr. Frank's presentation is lucid, engaging and ultimately shocking.

If you live in the United States you owe it to yourself to read book.
