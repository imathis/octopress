I have added <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/refer/" target="_blank">Refer 1.1</a> from <a href="http://www.textism.com/" target="_blank">Textism</a> to my site so that I might discover who is linked to my site. I get about two dozen hits a week but I have no real idea from where.

I must say that it was very easy to install. Now if only some one will link to me so I can see it in action.
