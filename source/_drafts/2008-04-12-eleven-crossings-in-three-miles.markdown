The townhouse where we live is near to a major rail corridor through town.  The city newsletter this week informed us of a multi-million dollar project to make improvements to the eleven grade crossings inside the city that will allow them to petition the Federal government for a "quiet zone."  This would mean that the 80, yes eighty, trains a day traversing these tracks would no longer be required to sound their horn for each crossing.

Eleven crossings times three (or more) horn soundings per crossing times eighty trains a day is 2640 trains horns per day.  Here's to hoping the improvements occur quickly and that the exemption is granted.
