This week marks the one year anniversary of our switch from Windows to Macintosh. Michele and I ventured into the Apple store in St. Louis on January 11, 2003 and haven't looked back ever since.

She is very satisfied with her 17" iMac and I love my 15" Titanium PowerBook. Within days of getting the new machines we had completed the switch from Windows ME and XP professional respectively. Only twice in the last twelve months have I even turned on my old Pentium machine. I'm thinking seriously about turning it into a Linux based server.

Through out this year I have continually found new depths to Mac OS X, and new application with which to plumb those depths. Being a software developer I was keenly interested in setting up a Java/Apache/Tomcat/Struts environment that allows me to build and deploy web applications with ease.

I have added immensely to my knowledge of Unix through the Free-BSD underpinnings of OS X. I now connect to the Internet through secure shells with port forwarding via tunnels.

And I am discovering the joy of being creative with software rather than solely being creative making software. Using iPhoto to create picture books of family activities throughout the year as Christmas gifts was easy and very rewarding. I want to spend more time with the whole iLife suite of applications, making movie slide shows of our photos, and transferring "I Love Lucy" VHS tapes to DVD.

Today's MacWorld Expo Keynote address couldn't have come at a better time for me. Seeing first hand demonstrations of the integration and power iPhoto, iDVD, iMovie, and iTunes have inspires me to try more things with my ideas. And even though I don't play a musical instrument, I am eager to play around with Garage Band just to see what I can accomplish on my own.

I've been using computers for over 20 years; they are a huge part of my daily life. How sweet it is to be able to use products, hardware and software, that still excite me and still make me want to explore my creative boundaries.

Apple isn't just making the best computer hardware and software in the world today. They are creating tools the free the imagination and give wings to the ideas, hopes, and inventions of everyday people.

Wow.
