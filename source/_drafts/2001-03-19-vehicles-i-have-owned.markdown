This list is pure ego gratification. I have finally reached a point in my emotional growth and                  understanding that I no longer feel the need to take care of what I imagine the feelings of others to                  be. If this list is seen in a particular light by anyone reading it then they should understand                  that the light is shinning on them, and not on me.

1984 Pontiac Fiero
1988 Honda Prelude
1992 Mazda Navajo
1994 BMW 318i
1992 Lexus ES300
1999 Nissan Altima

Currently our stable contains these two beauties.

2000 Lexus ES300
2001 Audi TT Coup√©

And if that isn't enough, here are the motorcycles I've owned.

1986 Yamaha Riva 180
1988 Yamaha Radian 600
1988 Suzuki Katana 1100F



Life is very good.
