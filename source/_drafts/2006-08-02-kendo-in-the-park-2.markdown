My kendo workouts continue to be good. Having a prior background in karate is surprisingly helpful. While there are virtually no shared techniques except for some of the footwork, the concepts are the same -- and I was always good at applying new concepts.

Working out outside has it challenges. Heat, bugs, various brain-dead cretins who cruise by and shout out their windows. But the shared experience makes up for all of that. What I have been missing most about karate was the camaraderie of participating with other people who have a common interest. I was never a team sport kind of guy, so I missed out on the team bonding that the football or basketball team might have in high school. I did try out for the wrestling team, but I didn't take to the intensity of the Coach's desire to win, Win, WIN!

Martial arts offers the chance to do an individual pursuit in a group setting. You work with partners, one on one, or sometimes two or three on one, and you practice by yourself - but with other people there. A good dojo (and I've found one here) will welcome you no matter what your skill level or dedication level. What is important is that each person is doing <em>their</em> best, striving to make <em>themselves</em> better.

Whatever the reason, I seem to excel at martial arts, and practicing seems to center me and bring me peace.
