In this <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/may/14musicstore.html" target="_blank">press release</a>, Apple announces that they've sold over 2 million songs in the 16 days since the iTunes Music store went live. By my math that's an average of 1.44 songs per second. Steve Jobs says that over half the songs downloaded from the service so far are part of an album purchase, dispelling the notion that people would buy just the songs they wanted and not entire albums.

Can  you imagine what will happen with iTunes for Window debuts?
