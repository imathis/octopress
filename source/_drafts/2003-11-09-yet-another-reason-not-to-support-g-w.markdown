<a href="http://www.veen.com/leslie/">Leslie Veen</a> was one of many who <a href="http://www.veen.com/leslie/archives/000367.html">talked</a> about the recent <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/11/images/20031105-1_p35410-21-515h.html">signing of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban</a>.

I completely agree with her statement, "I find it striking that not one of those pictured will be directly affected by the law they just enacted. How is that representational government?"

Whether you support the current administration's policies or not, you must realize that the neo-conservatives and the ultra-right Christian coalition have an agenda to rework this county, and indeed the world, in their image. They are using fear, uncertainty, and doubt to divide us and steal our democracy.

If we the people don't get out and vote and express our displeasure with our "elected" government we may well lose the ability to control it forever.
