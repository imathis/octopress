Over the weekend we took a short hike in the Konza Prairie Biologic Station located just outside of Manhattan Kansas. This prairie restoration project is vast, and only a portion is open to the public. Hiking there gives one a new appreciation for the incredible distances contained within the American prairie. Our two and a half mile hike was just a fraction of the distances covered by American settlers headed west in the late 1800s.
