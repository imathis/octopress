<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0434409/" title="V for Vendetta">V for Vendetta</a> is a very good movie, especially when you juxtapose its theme of control, propaganda, and truth in the news against current events. The best line in the movie goes something like, "We don't make up the news - that's the government's job."

Rating: V Stars
