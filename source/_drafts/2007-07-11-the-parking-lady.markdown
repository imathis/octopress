Now that I am working <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1300+Washington+St,+Kansas+City,+MO+64105+(Argus)&sll=38.884775,-94.714667&sspn=0.011124,0.017381&ie=UTF8&z=16&om=1" title="downtown">downtown</a> I park in an underground ramp.  My employer is nice enough to offset the cost of this (roughly $60 a month) so all I have to do is slow down at the gate while my token is scanned by the overhead reader and enter (or exit) the garage.

The entrance I use off of Washington Street has a booth that is manned for those visitors who don't have monthly parking passes.  In the mornings it is manned by a very cheerful woman who, if you smile and wave to her, will smile and wave to you in a manner that suggests she is delighted to see you.  It puts a smile on my face every day.

We need a word for those strangers in our lives that we see on a regular basis, that we have some interaction with, but whom we don't really know or maybe even speak to.
