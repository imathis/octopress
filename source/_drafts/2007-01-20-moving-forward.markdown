For the first time in a decade I am taking a new job that doesn't require a cross country move. And for the first time in ten years I'll be an employee and not a consultant. I'm excited about the changes ahead and eager to get started with the new company.

The past two and a half years have been very good for me career wise, and I've made some true friends here. Leaving this engagement will be bittersweet. I am looking forward to new challenges and new opportunities to learn and grow. I am not looking forward to leaving behind some of the people I've come to know here.

I'll write more about the new job, and my experiences there once I know for certain what (if any) blogging policy the new company has, especially regarding any mention of their business by employees. For now I am happy to say that I have a new job.
