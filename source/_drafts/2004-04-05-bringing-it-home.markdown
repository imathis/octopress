One of the hidden benefits of losing your job is the potential for losing your house as well. With no income the race between a new income source and the end of your savings account is underway. ( Since I was most recently independently employed, I am not eligible for unemployment compensation. )

We have enough on hand to last a "while", and we can sell our stocks to generate a slight extension to that "while." But our employment search must bear fruit soon or we'll be in real trouble.

So last week we put an ad in the newspaper, and bought a couple of "For Sale" signs and a big black marker. One of the signs came with an info tube attachment. The flyer in the tube pointed us to a <a href="http://infotube.net" title="InfoTube.net">web site</a> were we could create our <a href="http://infotube.gonehome.com/74226" title="Pool For Sale, House Included">own house listing</a> for free. Once the listing was completed we could print brochures and stick them in the tube.

The newspaper ad has generated some calls, but none serious enough to schedule a showing. The brochures keep disappearing from tube ( 32 in 4 days ) and some calls are coming from them as well.

We have had one serious call, from a realtor, that has put us in a bit of a tailspin. You see we spent the morning talking about seriously searching for ways to stay here rather than sell the house and move. No sooner had we finished that conversation when the phone rang. Now we have to decide how to handle a showing and potential offer.

On the one hand we want to be able to sell our home if we need to move, but on the other hand we don't want to have to deal with the showings and stress of trying to sell if we are going to stay. Having a realtor call with a potential buyer who wants a showing just brings home the fact that our lives are really in turmoil now.

Do we stay or do we go? Should I start my own business? Should that business be here or elsewhere? Should I take the first thing to come along, or wait for the "right" job? Do we sell the house ourselves or through a realtor? Do we move ourselves or hire it done? Is basing your future on winning the lottery as bad an idea as it sounds?

Life goes on and on.
