The Network Solutions "whois" record for zanshin.net indicates that it was originally registered on February 20, 1996. Nine years ago yesterday in other words. In terms of real significance this doesn't amount to much, but it does represent a fifth of my life. Oddly enough, this nine year span almost exactly matches the time I've known Michele and had her as a part of my life.

So happy birthday, Zanshin; many happy returns.
