At my follow-up exam yesterday the eye doctor measured my vision at twenty-twenty. That's with both eyes working together. The near eye is at twenty-thirty by itself, and is working perfectly for up close reading of the computer or books.

Other than some slight dryness in the right eye, he was pleased with my progress. He wants to see my one final time in about ten weeks, otherwise I am done.

<hr width="25%" />Overall I am very pleased with the results of this surgery. While my patience was sorely tried by the need for a second procedure, I am very happy to not need glasses at all for any activity. Because my vision had been stable for years before this procedure I am hopeful that my eyes won't degrade (much) over time.

I would recommend this to others with the caveat that you are certain you want to alter your vision forever. This is not a cosmetic procedure. For me, getting rid of bifocals has been more than worth it, and since my astigmatism prevented contacts, this was my only option.  Even with that driving me this has not been easy.
