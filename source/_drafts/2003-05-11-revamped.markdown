I have started the process of rebuilding my site with a new style. I am pleased with the overall structure of things so far. I still need to hammer out some of the details and clean up some of my HTML and CSS code.

Please feel free to use the comments feature to point out any glitches you may find. If you do comment I would like to know the browser and OS that you are using. Thanks.
