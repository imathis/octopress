The next time you are in your local grocery store, head on over to the back of the produce section, where they keep the potatoes. Grab, all at once, seven five-pound bags of any kind of potato.

Yes, seven five-pound bags.

That is how much weight I've lost since the beginning of June. To say thirty-five pounds seems like a lot. To actually hold it in your hands is an entirely different understanding. Finger strength notwithstanding, trying to carry through the store thirty-five pounds of potatoes is not easy. It's no wonder that my knees hurt and I was short of breath going up stairs.
