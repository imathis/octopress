The image seen below is taken from my <a href="http://shortstat.shauninman.com" title="ShortStat">ShortStat</a> page. It is the list of browsers that have visited my humble page in the past two weeks or so. All the browsers version are included here, i.e. each row is a summary row by browser type. The version shown is the highest version seen.
