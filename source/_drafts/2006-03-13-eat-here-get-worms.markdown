The shortest route between Overland Park and Decatur takes you along Route 54 in Missouri and Illinois. Shortly after crossing the Mississippi River heading east you come to a small cross roads called Atlas Illinois. At the four-way stop there is a general store with a sign out front. In a classic "eats, shoots and leaves" moment, the sign reads, "EAT HERE GET WORMS."

I had to take <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zanshin/111998085/" title="Eat Here Get Worms">a picture</a>.
