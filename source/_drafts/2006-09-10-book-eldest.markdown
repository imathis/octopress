<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eldest-Inheritance-Book-Christopher-Paolini/dp/037582670X/sr=8-1/qid=1157976987/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0105091-9313444?ie=UTF8&s=books" title="Eldest">Eldest</a></i> is the second book of Christopher Paolini <i>Inheritance</i> trilogy. It's a good story, one that I am enjoying, even if it is aimed at a young(er) audience.

Rating: Hurry up with the third book already
