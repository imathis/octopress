It wasn't really 108 here today, but that was the temperature according to the car after it had sat in the late afternoon sun (5:30 - 6:30 pm) while I had dinner at Outback Steakhouse.

One hundred and eight degrees.

Summer doesn't start for another two weeks.

Yee-haw.

(Forgive the blurry picture, in my haste to get the picture I held the camera phone too close to the gauge.)
