I have to pay in order to park at work. 480 bucks a year, or roughly $2 per day. It isn't much when you consider that the lot is close (less than a block away) and I always have a space.

That is unless the bozos across the street from the lot park there. Three times now in less than 2 months these morons have parked in my space. The first time I managed to attract their attention through an open window and they grudgingly moved their car. The last two times I've simply called the lot owner and he gives me a free space elsewhere in the lot for the day and has the offending car towed.

These cow-heads have been towed twice now in less than a month.

Stupid.
