In the previous two Presidential Election cycles I made good use of the resources found at <a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/" title="Project Vote Smart">Project Vote Smart</a>, especially the "political courage test."  Over the weekend I took some time to poke around the biographies of the major candidates for 2008 and was dismayed to discover that none of them have completed the  test.  C'mon candidates, be grown-up and provide us some answers already.  Otherwise I'll be forced to cast my vote based on your favorite food.

And since there is one candidate whom I like, who lists chili as his/her favorite food, I guess I'm all set for November.
