<a title="Android Data Leak Patch" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/228146/google_issues_patch_to_plug_android_data_leaks.html">Android Data Leak Patch Issued</a> â†’<br /> Google has released a patch that addresses a potential data leak issue. The real question is, how long will it take the various carriers to push the patch to their customers.

update: Turns out it's a <a title="Google Android Fix" href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/18308/google_android_security_flaw">server side fix</a> and will roll out over the next few days. The carriers and their customers need do nothing. Plus one for Google.
