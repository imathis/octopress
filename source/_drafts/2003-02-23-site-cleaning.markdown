I've been doing some light site cleaning. I've removed some links from the 'elsewhere' menu that I no longer frequent. When I have the time and inclination I'll add some of the other links that have found their way to my daily visit list.

I also added two RSS feed links to the bottom of the menu panel. One for 0.91 and one for 1.0. I downloaded NetNewsWire Lite today, and have been exploring the possibilities it represents. Since moveabletype, the site management software I use, provides the necessary formats for these aggregators, I went ahead and added the syndication links for your use.
