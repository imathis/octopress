After not a little work, I've managed to convert my web site to a content management system called 'Moveable Type'. It is freely available at <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">moveabletype.org</a>. If you maintain a blog, or would like to, I can highly recommend it.

There are a few wrinkles to work out yet; my history isn't working, and the format of my signature isn't quite what I had in mind. But the content is coming from the database, and the general formatting is correct.

My hope is that using this software will allow me to focus on capturing my thoughts without having to focus on the nuts and bolts of HTML to display them.

Stay tuned... more to come.
