It's beginning to look and feel like Christmas around here. Yesterday we traveled over to my parents house to help decorate their tree. It was also my sister-in-laws birthday, so there was cake and presents. It was enjoyable to spend the afternoon and early evening with family. We played 'Uno' and laughed and visited and generally had a wonderful time.

Today Michele and I set up our tree, and decorated the living room. We have Santa as a theme, so there are several Santa's big and small around the room. Each year after Christmas we visit our favorite interior store and collect new ornaments at reduced prices. So the first presents of the year are putting up the new pretties on the tree. In addition to some expensive and very "Currier and Ives" decorations, we also have some gaudy, cheap-o-depot stuff. Because it wouldn't be Christmas without some trashy decorations.

We played Christmas music, drank egg nog, and had a thoroughly good time.
