<a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a> is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/space/11/05/voyager.solar.boundary.ap/index.html">reporting</a> that Voyager 1 has left the solar system.

Well not completely. But it is believed to be in the region of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopause"><i>heliopause</i></a>. With another 17 years or so of power on-board scientists should get a chance to discover what's out there.

Can you imagine that a man made object is now traveling at 1,000,000 miles per day and is 90 times farther away from us than the sun? Incredible.
