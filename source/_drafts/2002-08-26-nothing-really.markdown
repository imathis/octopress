Sorry for the lack of posts here lately. I guess I have been doing pretty good on the whole. I've been feeling tired a lot lately and finally decided it was stress from work. I have managed to take some time off here and there and that is helping. I took last Friday off, and this coming weekend is Labor day. So a couple of 4-day weeks ~ that's nice.

In mid-September we are taking a 5-day mini-vacation to western New York to visit the "I Love Lucy" museum and one of Michele's many childhood homes. I am very much looking forward to be cut off from the world for 5 days.

And it's only 119 days until our Hawaii cruise in December... not that anyone is counting.
