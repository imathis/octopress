<a href="http://www.staceywaspe.com/archives//2005/06.30_things_i_n.html" title="Things I need">This</a> may very well be one of the best things I've ever read about grieving. Having lost my sister when I was just twelve I could articulate how it felt and what I needed. Stacey Waspe's words capture the truth of the process, simply and accurately.

In the last eight months my wife lost both of her parents. She is moving through her grief, and I am moving through my own grief process. Reading <a href="http://www.staceywaspe.com/archives//2005/06.30_things_i_n.html" title="Things I need">this</a> posting helped to put into perspective what Michele is going through.

I am grateful for people who can articulate their deepest emotions and processes in the moment, and who are also brave enough to share with the rest of the world.
