Recently at work I was chosen through a random drawing to receive a pair of tickets to see the Kansas City Royals host the Chicago White Sox.  It has been years and years since I last saw a professional baseball game so I was very much looking forward to it.

The weather was not cooperative, threatening rain all day and finally starting to rain about 15 minutes before game time.  Our seats couldn't have been better, either for viewing the game or staying dry; on the third base line just about even with the base itself, and up on the Club level, under the upper deck overhang.  We were comfortably out of the rain and enjoyed ourselves people watching during the 90 minute rain delay.  Once the rain stopped and play started it was a beautifully cool evening - perfect for watching a little baseball.

We only stayed for the first 5 innings, given the nearly 9:00 pm first pitch, but had a wonderful time nonetheless.  Bratwurst and Polish sausage (with sauerkraut) were had, as was a tub of popcorn.

My new employer has a block of seats, primarily for entertaining customers, but the left overs are given away to employees through a random drawing every couple of weeks.  I'm already signed up for the next batch of games.
