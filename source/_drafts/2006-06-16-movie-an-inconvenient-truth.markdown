A powerful, compelling, and thought-provoking look at perhaps the most spun issue of our times, global warming. No matter what side of this issue you consider to be truthful you owe it to yourself to see this documentary. With the exception of one brief segment about the contested 2000 Presidential Election, the film stays on point and address the issue directly. <i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0497116/" title="An Inconvenient Truth">An Inconvenient Truth</a></i> is perhaps the most important movie you will see. This year or any other.

Rating: Go see this movie. Take everyone you know with you.
