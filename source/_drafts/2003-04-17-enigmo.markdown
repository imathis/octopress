I have discovered a new game, called "Enigmo", from Pangea, for the Mac, which you can learn more about <a href="http://www.pangeasoft.net/enigmo/info.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It is a puzzle game that requires you control the flow of up to three different liquids using slides, accelerators, trampolines, and funnels. The demo version of the game has 10 levels, buying it released 40 more levels of play. The game allows you to build your own levels.

The graphics are superb, and the game is addictive. It is the best game I have played in years. One more reason I am glad I switched to Mac OS.
