I spent the last week or so listening to <a href="http://audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_TIME_000382&BV_UseBVCookie=Yes" title="Blink! The Power of Thinking Without Thinking">Blink! The Power of Thinking Without Thinking</a> in the car, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. An exploration into our intuitive selves, Blink! examines our ability to "thin slice" information and to make amazingly accurate inferences from tiny bits of information. This book will alter the way you look at your thoughts.

Rating: Buy it and listen to it. Twice.
