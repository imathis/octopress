The move to a new office building seems to have gone very smoothly.  All of my office items where here waiting for me upon my arrival Monday, and better still, none were broken or damaged.  There was network connectivity and my phone worked.  Almost anti-climatic after the several weeks of build up.

The new space is very nice.  For the first time in a decade I can see a window from where I sit.  Working as an employee rather than as a consultant continues to produce new benefits.  The part of the building I am in holds about 30 cubes, most of which are filled.  Between the cloth covered cube walls and some art work on the building walls it is surprisingly quiet here.  My last cube opened onto the hallway leading to the stairs and the restrooms, so I had a lot of foot traffic behind me all day.  Now I am in a dead-end aisle which makes it very quiet.
