Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a site called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://mydogmeg.net" title="mydogmeg.net archive">mydogmeg.net</a>.  Part of that site was a subdomain called geek.mydogmeg.net.  Geek was a collection of reference sites organized in to categories and beautifully displayed through CSS.

Mydogmeg has been off the air for some time now, and I have missed its content, and I have missed the geek subdomain as well.  One of the benefits of switching to Blue Host is the ability to have subdomains of my own.

So without further ado, I give you <a href="http://geek.zanshin.net" title="geek.zanshin.net">geek.zanshin.net</a>.

<strong>NB</strong>. I haven't tested these links in a long time, so many, or all, of them might be dead.  I'll be updating them in the coming days.  Please feel free to use the comments to point out dead ones, or give me new live ones you think are worth of listing.
