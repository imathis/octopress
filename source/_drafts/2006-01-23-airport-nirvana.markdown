I found a bit of nirvana today; at least airport nirvana. With more than an hour to kill before my connecting flight boards I needed a place to sit, maybe eat some food, and be away from the teeming masses that surge through airports like so many lemming migrations.

What I found was a set of two chairs, off to the side, next to a working power outlet, and with a full strength Wi-Fi signal. In sight of the departure gate. So while I recharge my batteries all my toys are getting recharged as well.

One 90 minute flight to go and I'm home. Or at least down to a 45 minute drive from home.
