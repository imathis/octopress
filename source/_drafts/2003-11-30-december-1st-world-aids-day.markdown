Five million people acquired HIV in 2003, bringing the world total to 40,000,000 people who are living with HIV today.

Of these 38,600,00 are adults, 19,200,000 are women, and 3,200,000 are children under the age of 15.

Three million people died from HIV/AIDS in 2003, making this most lethal year to date for this affliction.

It isn't over.
