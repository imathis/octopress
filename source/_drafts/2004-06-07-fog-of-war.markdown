McNamara"</a> yesterday. It was an absolutely compelling look at events from the fire bombing of sixty seven (yes 67) cities in Japan during World War II to Vietnam, and the Cuban Missile Crisis.

We need more films like this one that examine the events of our time through the eyes of key participants.
