This entry here at zanshin.net world domination headquarters is the thousandth since we starting counting back in December 1999. Clever readers may note that the posting URL actually says one thousand fifty three. Turns out that Movable Type, the content management system employed by <em>el presidente for life</em> Mark, uses the same pool of numbers for all the blogs under its domain. Therefore the extra fifty odd entries are from other sites that I have managed at one time or another.

If you are counting sit-ups or stairs, a thousand is a big number. If you are talking about stars in the universe or people on Earth, a thousand is pretty small. When you consider that these thousand entries span a sixth of my life, encompassing four deaths, two births, three job losses, and their subsequent cross-country moves, then it is a large number indeed.

Here's the first thousand, and to many, many more.
