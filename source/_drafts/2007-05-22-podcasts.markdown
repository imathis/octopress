I'm late coming to the whole Podcast scene.  To me it seemed like talk radio, only performed by amateurs.  Recently, however, at a friends recommendation, I have started actively listening to one.  <a href="http://mydailyphrase.com/german" title="My Daily Phrase: German">My Daily Phrase: German</a>.

I've been learning a word or phrase or two every day on my way to work and back. It's basically a free language tape that I can play on my iPod.  This is where the Internet, and the wealth of services and information really shines.  That I can get, for free, a high quality language learning system delivered to my home is amazing.

If you haven't explored the range of Podcasts, if you were like me and thought there is nothing there of interest, I suggest you go and look again.
