Over at <a href="http://www.maniacalrage.net/" title="Maniacal Rage">Maniacal Rage</a> there is a new posting, <a href="http://www.maniacalrage.net/archives/2004/02/bush_will_do_whatever_he_wants.php" title="Bush Will Do Whatever He Wants">Bush Will Do Whatever He Wants</a>.

I couldn't agree more with every thing Garrett Murray says about Herr Bush. From the day he was appointed to office he has operated exactly like a spoiled little rich kid. He openly admits that he doesn't read newspapers, and it appears that the circle of advisors he listens to is increasing small.

Make sure you participate in the electoral process this year.
