In any relationship there are dates of significance. Today, August 12, is one such date for Sibylle and I. Three years ago today we met in person for the first time. We had been introduced to each other on eHarmony nineteen days earlier and had already traded well over a hundred emails.

Six months ago today we were married in a quiet, private ceremony.

Both of us are introverts and therefore found the idea of a date terrifying. We had talked about just being in the same place at the same time. Perhaps a bookstore or coffee shop. We could sit together or apart, read or talk or just be together quietly. As it happened our first meeting was in a concourse at the Kansas City International Airport. We sat together and walked. We were quiet, and we talked. We held hands and she gently rested her head on my shoulder.

We have been together ever since.

Happy anniversary, Sibylle, I love you.
