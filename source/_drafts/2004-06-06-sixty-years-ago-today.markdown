Ten years ago today I was in Germany for the start of a two-week motorcycle tour of the Alps. Sitting in my room trying to stay awake until it was at least 9 PM locally, I turned on the television. Not speaking the language I was more interested in seeing what foreign programming looked like. The first channel I visited was broadcasting a news program.

It was obvious that the announcer was standing on the Normandy beaches. Knowing that it was (then) the 50th anniversary of the D-Day Landings I could intuit what the report was about. However I had the distinct feeling that the report I was seeing, but unable to understand, was different in its content than similar broadcasts from American news programs from the same beaches that evening. For the first time in my life I truly understood that the rest of the world has a vastly different perspective than those of us in America.
