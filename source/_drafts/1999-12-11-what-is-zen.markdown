There is only one person we must encounter during our life, <br />
a person we must meet as if we were in passionate love.<br />
Who is that person?<br />
It is the essential Self, the True Self.<br />
You must meet this person<br />
And as long as you do not,<br />
It will be impossible to truly be satisfied in your heart.<br />
To meet your self is said to be the purpose of human life.<br />
This is also the objective of Buddhism.<br />
The shortest, most concrete way to do this is Zen.<br />
<br /><br />
Why is it that people worry and suffer?<br />
Why is it that people seek for peace of mind and satori?<br />
It is all because of the activity of ego-self created opinions.<br />
Shakyamuni Buddha was the first human being<br />
to realize that obstacles to the Way of reaching True Awakening<br />
are ego-self created opinions.<br />
By truly being one with these delusive ego-self created opinions,<br />
he realized No Self.<br />
<br /><br />
What is Zen?<br />
It is to live your everyday life accepting all facets of reality<br />
without mixing in ego-self created opinions.<br />
<br />
What is reality?<br />
Understanding, not understanding, unclear, ambiguous:<br />
These are all your reality.<br />
Other than your own reality,<br />
There is nothing else to seek.<br />
<br /><br />
What is anger? What is ignorance? What is greed?<br />
It is to Thoroughly and without resistance accept these things as they are.<br />
<br /><br />
Zen refers to our life and reality itself.<br />
It is to be one with anxiety as it is or haste as it is<br />
without seeking for peace of mind or a quiet condition.<br />
Without thinking on your own that:<br />
"Anger is mistaken and happiness is correct"<br />
Sadness is bad and comfort is good",<br />
the practice of quietly making reality your own<br />
is the practice of Zen.<br />
