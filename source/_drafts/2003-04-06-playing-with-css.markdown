I am playing around with a new look and feel for the site. You can see a mock up <a href="http://www.zanshin.net/template.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Give it a go and let me know what you think. The new site is pure CSS and XHTML valid. I haven't completed the supporting archive, about, and link pages yet, not have I worked the moveableType tags I want to use into this design yet. Hopefully I'll have it all ready for prime-time in the next few days.

In other site related news, I found a link to my site on <a href="http://mydogmeg.com" target="_blank">one</a> of the sites I frequent. It was most gratifying indeed. Thank you Shannon.
