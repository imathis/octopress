For the first time in over three weeks I slept more than a handful of hours last night. I've been struggling with either a seasonal allergy or some kind of sinus thing for about 10 days, and last night I tried some Benadryl, which seemed to work. It also made me drowsy. Shortly after 8:00 o'clock I was in bed asleep.

Although I was awake twice in the night I was able to go back to sleep quickly both times. I didn't wake up until 5:00 o'clock this morning. While I'm no where near 100% yet I am feeling better this morning than I have for a while.

Life goes on.
