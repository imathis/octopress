I've completed an extensive overhaul of my site. I believe everything is working now, except for the track back link for each posting. Since I've never had a track back this is not a major concern.

I used a design from the <a href="csszengarden.com" title="CSS Zen Garden">CSS Zen Garden</a> called "utilitarian" as the base for this design. Originally it didn't make use of columns, but I refactored it with the help of the <a href="http://www.inknoise.com/experimental/layoutomatic.php" title="Layout-a-matic">Layout-o-matic</a> site.

I hope you like it as much as I do; please let me know if anything works especially well, or even if it doesn't.
