What better way to start off the new year than with a new job?  I recently accepted a position as Software Architect with the <a title="OME" href="http://ome.ksu.edu" target="_blank">Office of Mediated Education</a> at <a title="Kansas State University" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_University" target="_blank">Kansas State University</a>.  I'll be working with several teams that develop and support web-based applications for use in online classrooms, student ratings, grade submission, and a university-wide authentication system among others.

I am very excited by this turn of events, and both Sibylle and I are looking forward to completing our move to Manhattan Kansas at the end of the month.
