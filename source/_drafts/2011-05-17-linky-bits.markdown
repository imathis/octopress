For a while I was using Delicious to capture links to thinks I found interesting and a sidebar plugin here on my site to show the last ten of those links to you. However, Delicious has an uncertain future and so I am changing things around here a little. I've added "asides" to my site, which allow me to create mini-posts that are slightly different in formatting from regular posts.

While I won't have the convenience of the largely automated Delicious process going forward, I will be able to add links in the main stream of my site, something I've wanted for some time. As my posting schedule is somewhat erratic having links should help to keep the feed a bit fresher.
