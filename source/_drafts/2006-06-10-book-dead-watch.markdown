I've always enjoyed John Sandford's <i>Prey</i> series and I especially like the <i>Kidd</i> books, so I was interested to see what <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399153543/sr=8-1/qid=1149994412/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-8820890-2075017?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="Dead Watch">Dead Watch</a></i>, a standalone story, would be like. I wasn't able to put it down.

Rating: The only problem with finishing this in one day is that I have nothing to read tomorrow.
