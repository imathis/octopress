Today's reading is from the Book of Corporate Life. Chapter 1, verses 1-15:
<span>
<ol>
<li class=".li">In the beginning was the Plan.</li>
<li class=".li">And then came the Assumptions.</li>
<li class=".li">And the Assumptions were without form.</li>
<li class=".li">And the Plan was without Substance.</li>
<li class=".li">And darkness was upon the face of the Workers.</li>
<li class=".li">And the Workers spoke among themselves saying, "It is a crock of shit and it stinks."</li>
<li class=".li">And the Workers went unto their Supervisors and said, "It is a crock of dung and we cannot live with the smell."</li>
<li class=".li">And the Supervisors went unto their Managers saying, "It is a container of organic waste, and it is very strong, such that none may abide by it."</li>
<li class=".li">And the Managers went unto their Directors, saying, "It is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide its strength."</li>
<li class=".li">And the Directors spoke among themselves, saying to one another, "It contains that which aids plant growth, and it is very strong."</li>
<li class=".li">And the Directors went to the Vice Presidents, saying unto them, "It promotes growth, and it is very powerful."</li>
<li class=".li">And the Vice Presidents went to the President, saying unto him, "It has very powerful effects."</li>
<li class=".li">And the President looked upon the Plan and saw that it was good.</li>
<li class=".li">And the Plan became Policy.</li>
<li class=".li">And that is how shit happens</li>
</ol>
