Yesterday we got out of the house and "blew the stink off" as my mother-in-law would say. We took a short road trip to St. Louis and had lunch a <a href="http://www.redrobin.com" title="Red Robin">Red Robin</a>, one of our favorite burger places. They have the best Freckled (strawberry) lemonade. Afterwards we stopped at a <a href="http://www.krispykreme.com" title="Krispy Kreme">Krispy Kreme</a> for a dozen doughnuts.

The ride down and back was delightful. We talked about our fears and worries regarding our current situation. We also talked about friends and family, the right, abortion, the prison system, and life in general. It was a great day. We really needed to get out of the routine here and do something just for us.

And as a bonus this morning's breakfast was delicious!
