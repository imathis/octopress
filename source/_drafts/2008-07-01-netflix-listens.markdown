Recently it was reported that <a title="Netflix" href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a> was eliminating the profile feature on their web site.  Profiles allow you to create sub-queues of movies for family members or others in your household, which are independent from the account holder's queue.  You could create a one-movie at a time, G-rated profile for a child, for example.

The public reason given for eliminating the profile feature was to simplify the web site.  In the days that followed the announcement, it seems the Netflix heard from many of its uses, and moreover, they listened to what those users were saying.

On the Netflix blog today, there is a new posting, <a title="Profile features NOT going away" href="http://blog.netflix.com/2008/06/profiles-feature-not-going-away.html">Profile features NOT going away</a>.  That's good business.
