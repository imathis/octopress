Michele and I have returned from our Thanksgiving trip to the Outer Banks. We had a good visit with her mom, Virginia, and a good trip overall. Driving 2200 miles in less than 5 days is not a treat, but we took good care of ourselves by forcing an overnight stay mid-way through rather than doing a forced march to complete the drive all at once.

I kept notes of my thoughts and have posted them as entries, dated roughly at the times I had them. Traveling with a Powerbook is wonderful. Traveling to the ends of the Earth in OBX (Outer Banks) means no easy connection. So I resorted to notes.

We are getting geared up for the major holiday of the year, Christmas. Which means there will be lots of fodder for entries. Occasions of high drama and emotion and my family do not mix well. Stay tuned.
