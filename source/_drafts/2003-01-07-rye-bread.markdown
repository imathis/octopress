Yesterday I went to the store, shopping list in hand, and managed to find every item on the list except for rye bread. When I got to the bread aisle there were hundreds of loaves, in dozens of flavors. Flavors that I, quite frankly, don't want to even try, much less eat. But no rye bread with caraway seeds. No seedless rye either. I realize that living in the Midwest you have to give up some more cosmopolitan treats, but rye bread?

I wish the bread makers would stick to the basics, white, wheat, and rye, before coming up with oat bran nut and oatmeal potato. It's the yeast they can do...
