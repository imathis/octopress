Tonight I had occasion to visit a Best Buy. I had previously been dimly aware that the console gaming world is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the new Wii system. Rounding the corner into the parking lot I was presented with a line of tents. And warmly clad nerds huddled together in the frigid 37 degree air.

Camping. On a sidewalk. Concrete. For a game. One that you'll be able to buy any old time soon. Somehow having it first is important.

I don't get it.

Perhaps I am not as nerdy as I thought.
