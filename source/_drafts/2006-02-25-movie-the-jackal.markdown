<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0119395/" title="The Jackal">The Jackal</a> is a remake of the classic <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0069947/" title="The Day of The Jackal">1973 version</a>. The earlier version is altogether better. This Bruce Willis version is fairly well done, and the addition of Sidney Poitier brings the movie up a full notch. Still, it has none of the <i>elan</i> of the first movie.

Rating: If you watch this version you <strong>must</strong> watch the original
