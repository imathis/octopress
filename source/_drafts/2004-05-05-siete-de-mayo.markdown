I know that most people celebrate Cinco de Mayo, but myself, I'm into Siete de Mayo. Specifically the one 43 years ago.

That's right, in just two days I'll be a whopping 43 years young. If I live to be 86 I'm middle aged. Three of my four grandparents made it to 90, so I figure I've got a couple more years yet before the long downhill slide. Or not.

All I want this year for my birthday is a job. Nothing fancy please, Just 9 to 5. Maybe a lunch break. Some light coding, maybe a application design or two. Put a big red bow on it and I'm there.
