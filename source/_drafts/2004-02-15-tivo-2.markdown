Almost three years ago my wife and I acquired a <a href="http://www.tivo.com" title="Tivo">Tivo</a>. It changed the way we watched television, but only in the living room. Elsewhere in the house we were still watching the old fashioned way. And it seems we were watching more TV elsewhere and less with the Tivo.

After talking about it a few times recently we pulled the trigger yesterday on getting a second Tivo. The new one will reside on our office, and is already plugged into the home network. The original one is going to move from the living room to our bedroom for late evening use.

Later today I'm going to visit the local Barnes and Noble bookstore to peruse the Tivo hacking books to see about extracting video from the Series 2 to Michele's iMac where it can be burned to DVD for posterity.
