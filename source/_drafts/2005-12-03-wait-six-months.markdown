This morning I screwed up my resolve and went to the credit union to have Michele taken off our joint account. To my surprise the bank officer there counseled me to wait at least six months before proceeding with her removal. As she put it, "Once her name is off the account there is no way to put it back on, and if you get something, like a tax refund, that has both names it will be extremely difficult to sort out." At the very least she advised me to wait until after this year's taxes were completed and any refund had been received.

I wasn't looking forward to dealing with this piece of administrivia anyway. I can wait until May to take another run at it.
