<a title="Amateur Neurotica" href="http://www.amateurneurotica.com">Amateur Neurotica</a> has a new posting about those incredibly <a title="The Wonders of Technology" href="http://www.amateurneurotica.com/archives/the-wonders-of-technology">annoying telemarketing phone calls</a> that greet you with a computerized voice when you answer the phone.  I couldn't agree more with the sentiment expressed in her posting.  I would add, however, that until you endure the computerized greeting, and the hold time, and tell the human at the other end of the wire not to call your number any more, your phone number will remain on their list for future calls.
