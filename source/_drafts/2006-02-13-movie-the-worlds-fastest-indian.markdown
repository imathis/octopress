An altogether excellent film about the indomitable spirit of Burt Munro and his quest to prove his largely hand-built Indian motorcycle was the fastest in the world. Along the way he meets and charms a number of ordinary people. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Burt Munro, and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0412080/" title="The World's Fastest Indian">The World's Fastest Indian</a> is a perfect Sunday afternoon movie.

Rating: Go see it in the theater
