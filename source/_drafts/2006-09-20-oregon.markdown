This week I am on vacation in Oregon with my father. He is attending a photography seminar and I am along to just have fun. The coastline here is rugged and beautiful. The defining feature is outcroppings of rock known as "haystacks." And when miles of rugged, unspoiled coastline start to wain, it is only an hour's drive to the nearest Redwood grove in northern California.

Spending time with my father has been good. We haven't traveled together for perhaps fifteen years, maybe more. Our time together has been relaxed and easy going. After years of not always seeing eye-to-eye we are getting along better , and it feels good to share this time with him.
