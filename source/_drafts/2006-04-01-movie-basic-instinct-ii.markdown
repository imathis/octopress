What I like about <i>film noir</i> is the increasing state of confusion with which the central protagonist often finds himself embroiled. Where are the lies and where is the truth? <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0430912" title="Basic Instinct II">Basic Instinct II</a> captures, through plot twists and misdirection, much of what makes good film noir good film.

Unfortunately, I think this movie will suffer for the base aspects of sex and nudity that will be talked about and used to wrongly categorize a very good thriller.

Rating: Sexy who dunnit with an attitude
