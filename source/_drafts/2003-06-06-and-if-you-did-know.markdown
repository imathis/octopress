My wife now has her own blog and her own site. For years as a therapist, when confronted with a patient who would claim, "I don't know," to questions, she responded with a question of her own. "And if you did know?"

Today she is undergoing a journey into herself. She is chronicling her thoughts as she moves along her path. Today she is asking herself, "And if you did know?"

You can read along in her diary here: <a href="http://www.andifyoudidknow.com">andifyoudidknow.com</a>. Or you can click on the "michele" link on the menu to your left.
