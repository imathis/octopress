I have added a counter to my page that shows an estimate of the Iraqi body count as a result of the current war against them. I found out about it at <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/" target="_blank">zeldman.com</a>. Here is the posting he used to talk about it:

<div style="font-size: 12px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30 px; text-align: justify;">
<a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/" target="_blank">Iraq Body Count</a> documents reported civilian casualties in Iraq and provides variously sized <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/webcounters.htm" target="_blank">casualty counters</a> you can add to your site. Counter figures are updated in real time via JavaScript. As non-combatant children and adults are reported to have been killed, the counters on your site will roll over to reflect the latest figures.

&#8220;Civilian casualties are the most unacceptable consequence of all wars,&#8221; say the site&#8217;s <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/contacts.htm" target="_blank">founders</a>. &#8220;Each civilian death is a tragedy and should never be regarded as the &#8216;cost&#8217; of achieving our countries&#8217; war aims, because it is not we who are paying this price.&#8221;
