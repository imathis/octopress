This is simply one of the best rock concerts I've ever heard. <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008OWZC/sr=8-1/qid=1149609881/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0791549-1866460?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="How The West Was Won">How The West Was Won</a></i> is Led Zeppelin at their very best. The concert is flawless, and the band shows off an incredible range of music from driving vocals and guitar, to an amazing drum solo.

Rating: If you love rock-n-roll you owe it to yourself to get this CD.
