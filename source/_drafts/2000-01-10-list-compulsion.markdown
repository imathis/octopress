I was raised by list makers. Growing up I could determine the importance and duration         of future events from the list making activities of my parents. Grocery lists, gift lists, book         lists. Lists of books to buy, lists of book already bought. Yes, even lists of lists.

Growing up in that alphabetized and ordered world I learned to make lists myself. For a time         I stopped making lists. My little rebellion against the ordered world. It didn't take as         I still write things down. My wife will tell you that I write everything down and then         keep all the little scraps of paper. For a time this was really compulsive. For years         whenever I would move to a new apartment or house I'd take along boxes filled with old         scraps of paper. Stuff I hadn't looked at since I wrote it down, but nothing that I could         bear to part with.

Today I am more relaxed. I don't feel the need to write as many things down, and I've         learned to empty my pockets into the trash can at the end of the day. The only list I         really use anymore (on paper, anyway) is the grocery list. I have a page-a-day calendar on          my desk and I use the old pages as a note pad. I carefully write out all the things we need         and then stick it in my pocket. When I come home, with all the items crossed off I hesitate         at the trash can. Do I need this list?

Hmmm.

Milk
Eggs
Romain Lettuce
Cucumber
Celery
Garlic
Onion (red and white)
