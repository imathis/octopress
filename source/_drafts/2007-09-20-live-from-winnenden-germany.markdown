Sibylle and I are making good use of a small internet cafe in Winnenden Germany, near where her mother lives.  We've been able to check our email, copy pictures from cameras to our portable hard drive, and generally feed our nerd needs.

Computers are universal, it seems, although there are some differences.  The German keyoard has some extra keys, for ß, and ö, ä, and ü,  It also moves some of the symbols around.  Strg-Alt-Q is required for the at sign, for example.  The hardest change is that the Y key and the Z key are reversed in position.

We created a Wordpress.com site to record our travels on.  You can read our impressions and thoughts at <a href="http://sibylleandmark.wordpress.com" title="sibylleandmark.wordpress.com">sibylleandmark.wordpress.com</a>.
