What unique fraud challenges exist when building a online marketplace vs. regular e-commerce sites?  What is the role of machine learning in such systems and how can we adapt to new patterns we haven't seen before?  What visual tools are best suited to spotting fraud in complex systems?  We will discuss how we model attackers and look for suspicious patterns at scale to prevent fraud across the massive number of transactions handled by the Airbnb system every day.
