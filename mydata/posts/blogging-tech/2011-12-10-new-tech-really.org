Well, it appears this actually does work. I seem to be having a few
issues integrating with [[http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net][NanoBlogger]] but I'm sure I'll work those out.
The problems that I've seen are:
    1) It seems that adding or even updating a new entry is as costly
       as rebuilding the entire blog from scratch. Right now, that's
       OK. But what am I going to do when I have 10, or 100 postings?
       I hope NanoBlogger can handle this.
    2) NB seems to assume that its input files are hand-written in
       some legacy text editor called [[http://www.vim.org][Vim]] or something :-). While my
       strategy of using [[http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]' [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] keeps the flavor of NB in
       that it is written in a simple markup language, it doesn't seem
       to fit the NB model perfectly. There is nothing wrong with NB's
       markup, it is just that Org Mode's markup can easily be
       exported to virtually every other markup on the planet. So I
       just need to learn Org Mode markup, write my content in Org
       Mode, and then publish that data into whatever format I choose.
       Seems a better solution but NB isn't quite prepared for it.
    3) I would still like better integration with Org Mode and NB. The
       steps I've used to produce this entry are:
          - Ran a little shell script I wrote to create a new NB
             entry. All I do is give the shell script the title of the
             Org Mode file I want to store the new entry in and it
             does its magic, leaving me with an Org Mode skeleton for
             NB.
          - Edit the Org Mode file just created.
          - Use Org Mode to publish the entry. This just stores it in
            my local NB folder.
          - Run =nb update= to have my changes put into the local
            copy of the blog.
          - Run =nb preview= to view the changes before publishing.
          - Run =nb publish= to update my blog.

So, while they're are still some problems,  I have to say I love it.
The advantages of using Org Mode and the simple NB blogging engine on
both my local and production server is way cool.

[[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] is actually way cool. I've only started using it in the past
year and will likely spend years learning it as it supports so many
features. But, like all well-designed pieces of software, you don't
need to learn it all at once. I'll yabber about Org Mode another day.
In any case, I'm real happy with my blog and the ease with which I can
add postings to it.
