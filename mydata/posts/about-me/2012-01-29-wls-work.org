The following highlights the main features of Oracle Fusion Middleware 11g Release 1 (11.1.1):

    Oracle Web Services Manager (WSM) security and management has been completely redesigned and rearchitected. The previous release, Oracle WSM 10g, was delivered as a standalone product or as a component of the Oracle SOA Suite.
