Gmail2Gcal is an application that allows you to convert Gmail messages into Gcal appointments with notifications. The two primary use-cases that Gmail2Gcal was developed for is
 1) Automatically filter Gmail messages to provide Gcal alerts rather than Gmail alerts.
 2) Help prevent what I refer to as the /file and forget/ syndrome.

Gmail, and email in general, typically have a week system to alert you to important email. Gmail alert mechanisms typically include audible notifications, pop-ups, and visual notifications in the status bar. On the other hand, calendar events tend to have more notification options.

Even simple calendar notification systems provide functionality similar to Gmail alerts. But calendar event notifications can include ongoing alarms, alarms with snooze features, alarms that repeat periodically, sometimes called a /nag/ (this [[http://bit.ly/JW050V][Google search]] shows the popularity of nags), and more. 

Besides providing more notification mechanisms, calendar events provide a simple means to maintaining a relatively permanent record of emails. Emails tend to get filed, archived, relabeled, etc... But calendar events hang around. 

There are also many strategies for integrating calendar events with [[http://bit.ly/JW1Fjp][todo or task management]] systems (see this [[http://bit.ly/JW050V][Google search]]). 

There are many time management strategies, with [[http://bit.ly/JW2gl2][GTD]] probably being the most famous, that rely on an [[http://bit.ly/JW1Yuv][empty inbox]]. While constantly refiling messages out of your inbox is great, forgetting to return to revisit and process unhandled emails is not great. Excluding my personal frustrations with /filing and forgetting/, others (see this [[http://bit.ly/KfmR25][blog posting]]) have had this problem as well. Gmail2Gcal can help avoid the /file and forget/ syndrome.
