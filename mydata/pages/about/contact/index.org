*** Email
My email address is:

You cannot copy-and-paste the address as it is an image. Sorry about the inconvenience but it stops [[http://bit.ly/K5IdjZ][web crawlers]] from sending me spam.

* Footnotes

[1] I'm quite proud of that number. Why you ask? Three reasons.
1) 408 is the area code for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_valley][Silicon Valley]] -- The home for all true nerds. While I live in Boston, my heart is in San Jose. 
1) It is a vanity number. The number is 408-Neil-Smi, the first 7 letters of my name. Getting the number was simple but waiting 2 years until it or a similarly cool number became available was a bit trying.
1) It's simply geekilicious. I count this as an electronic toy and one can never have too many of those.

[2] It, of course, gets delivered to me via email. As mentioned above, paper is YAAM.

[3] Just in case you're wondering, the box number for my mailing address was carefully chosen. After learning assembler on the {{{absolute_link(/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series#Apple_II_Plus, Wikipedia's Apple II Plus page, Apple II Plus)}}} with its 8-bit [[http://bit.ly/K5IZxg][6502 processor]], I think it is more likely that I'll forget my name before I forget the highest number you can hold in 8 bits.

[4] I just got lucky on this apartment number. I didn't even notice that it was a cool number until my then 15yo son said that we had the *[[http://bit.ly/K5Hbob][pi]]* apartment (geekness is obviously hereditary). Once he pointed it out, I had no choice but to get a small gold, circular sticker so I could add the decimal point.
