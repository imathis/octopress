I happen to be partial to [[http://www.diigo.com][Diigo]]'s bookmarking facilities. I've been using it on and off for a few years. Like most bookmarking systems, Diigo allows you to tag your bookmarks and then display the tags in a cloud. Here's my tag cloud for my Diigo bookmarks.

  - *programming:* Hacker by nature. It seems self explanatory.
  - *boardgames, games, game, go:* Enjoy intellectual stimulation. I love puzzles, board games, especially board games that involve little or no luck. I like Facebook's Words With Friends. I'm a huge fan of the Gipf
